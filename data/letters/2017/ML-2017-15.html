Background
HUD Handbook 4000.1, Section III.A.3.c.ii requires an initial moratorium on foreclosures of properties within a Presidentially-Declared Major Disaster Area (PDMDA) for a ninety (90) day period from the date of each PDMDA declaration. The initial moratorium applies to the initiation of foreclosures and foreclosures already in process. Pursuant to Section III.A.3.c.ii (A), HUD may communicate further specific guidance for extension of moratorium periods for individual disasters.
Information on the above-referenced Hurricanes’ Affected Counties can be found on FEMA’s website at www.fema.gov or by calling a regional FEMA office. The FEMA Regional Contacts page, www.fema.gov/fema-regional-contacts, has links to phone numbers to their regional offices.
Mortgagees should direct affected borrowers with additional questions to FHA’s "Disaster Relief Options for FHA Homeowners" page, which may be accessed at http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/sfh/nsc/
Summary of Changes
HUD is extending its initial ninety (90) day foreclosure moratorium for Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria for an additional ninety (90) day period as such period relates to each individual PDMDA’s Declaration Date. These extensions are only applicable to the Individual Assistance Areas within the PDMDA.
Extension of the Foreclosure Moratorium
Due to the extensive damage caused by the three above-mentioned Hurricanes, HUD is exercising its authority to provide an extension of the initial foreclosure moratorium in only those counties that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has declared to be eligible for Individual Assistance (Affected Counties) for an additional 90 days, which will be until February 21, 2018 for Hurricane Harvey, March 9, 2018 for Hurricane Irma, and March 19, 2018 for Hurricane Maria. The extension of these three initial moratoriums applies to the initiation of foreclosures and foreclosures already in process.
