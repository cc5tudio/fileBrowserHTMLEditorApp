ML 2017-14: Annual Revisions to Base City High Cost Percentage, High Cost Area and Per Unit Substantial Rehabilitation Threshold for 2017 (08/31/17)
TO:	ALL FHA APPROVED MULTIFAMILY MORTGAGEES
Maximum mortgage amounts were revised by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (Public Law 110-161, approved December 26, 2007) (FY 2008 Appropriations Act). Section 221 of the General Provisions of Title II of Division K of the FY 2008 Appropriations Act revises the statutory exceptions to maximum mortgage amounts for the FHA Multifamily Housing Programs, listed in Section 221 of the FY 2008 Appropriations Act, by (1) substituting 170 percent for the 140 percent exception of any geographical area, and (2) substituting 215 percent for 170 percent as the maximum exception allowed for a specific project. Accordingly, the statutory revision allows the Secretary to grant exceptions to maximum mortgage limits for certain Multifamily Housing Programs by (1) up to 170 percent, (equivalent to a 270 percent multiplier) in geographical areas where cost levels so require or (2) up to 170 percent, or 215 percent in High Cost Areas, (equivalent to a 315 percent multiplier) where necessary on a project-by-project basis.
The law does not determine which areas are to be considered "High Cost Areas." Accordingly, the Office of Multifamily Production has developed a list of High Cost Areas for 2017. The threshold for a High Cost Area has been set for all areas (Special Limit Areas excepted) with a "calculated" High Cost Percentage (HCP) of 287.23 or greater, but because of the statutory cap of 170 percent or 270 multiplier, some localities have a higher HCP but still have the 270 multiplier.
The attached designated Annual Base City High Cost Percentages and High Cost Areas are effective January 1, 2017, for FHA multifamily mortgage insurance Firm Commitment applications and for amendments which have not been initially endorsed, and establishes new geographical areas to apply Base Percentages for High Cost Areas. The area multiplier is to be used for all localities in the state if only one city has been named in any state. If multiple cities are named in any state, use the multiplier for the city closest to the location of the city named in this Mortgagee Letter.
PER UNIT LIMIT FOR SUBSTANTIAL REHABILITATION FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2017
The 2016 Multifamily Accelerated Processing (MAP) Guide established a base amount of $15,000 per unit to define substantial rehabilitation for FHA insured loan programs. Section 5.1.D.2 of the MAP guide requires that this base amount be adjusted periodically based on the percentage change published by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or other inflation cost index published by HUD. Accordingly, the 2017 base amount per dwelling unit to determine substantial rehabilitation for FHA insured loan programs is $15,315.
SPECIAL LIMIT AREAS
Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the states of Alaska and Hawaii are Special Limit areas. Care should be taken to ensure that the appropriate limits are used for corresponding programs. The HCP for Special Limit Areas is 405 percent.
PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT
There are no information collection requirements in this Mortgagee Letter, and therefore the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520) does not apply. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless the collection displays a currently valid OMB control number.
