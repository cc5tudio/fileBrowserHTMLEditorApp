<!-- <h3>c.	Post-Approval Requirements</h3> -->
<p>Governmental Entities and HUD-approved Nonprofits must comply with the following requirements and restrictions for its FHA business operations in addition to continuing to operate in full compliance with the eligibility requirements outlined in this SF Handbook.</p>
<h3>i.	Consultant Services</h3>
<p>Consultant services provided under an independent contractor relationship (as opposed to an employer-employee relationship) must not constitute more than half of the nonprofit's activities in the operation of its FHA-approved programs. This measurement will be calculated by evaluating the ratio of nonprofit staff to contracted or consultant staff; the ratio of hours devoted to the implementation of the AHPP by nonprofit staff versus contracted or consultant staff; and the funds devoted to paying nonprofit staff compared to those paying contracted or consultant staff. The nonprofit must have the in-house resources and capacity to run its own programs, and contract for services on a temporary and supplementary basis.</p>
<p>Therefore, to ensure that the consultant services are provided on an arm&rsquo;s length basis, the nonprofit must disclose any written and/or side agreements with parties that may derive financial gain through the homeownership program. Disclosure must identify the name of the business Entity, and the individuals from the company who will be working with the nonprofit, the terms of the relationship and how the party will be compensated. Failure to adequately disclose may result in a conflict-of-interest determination.</p>
<p>The nonprofit must contact the Program Support Division (PSD) immediately at the Jurisdictional HOC if more than half of the nonprofit&rsquo;s activities are provided by consultants under an independent contractor relationship at any time during the approval period.</p>
<h3>ii.	Limitation on the Number of 203(k) FHA-Insured Mortgages</h3>
<p>A nonprofit is prohibited from further borrowing under its FHA Mortgagor approval if the nonprofit has 10 or more incomplete 203(k) developments at any given time.</p>
<h5>Exceptional Performance Waiver</h5>
<p>Nonprofit agencies with an exceptional performance record of successfully completing 203(k) developments (defined as those agencies that have successfully completed 20 or more 203(k) developments) may apply to the HOC for a waiver of the limitation on 203(k) Mortgages. This waiver request must contain a narrative describing the nonprofit agency's homeownership or long-term rental program; current audited financial statements with an unqualified opinion from a CPA for the prior three years; a listing of all Properties currently owned by the nonprofit agency (both conventional and government financed); a record of performance on all 203(k) Mortgages (current as well as previous Loans); as well as the evidence to support the sale or rental of these Properties. Nonprofit agencies that are approved for this waiver, for financing for more than 10 203(k) Mortgages at one time, will have it stated in their approval letter from the HOC.</p>
<h3>iii.	HUD Homes &ndash; Individual Property Files</h3>
<h4>(A)	Definition</h4>
<p>Individual Property Files refer to files that Governmental Entities and HUD-approved Nonprofits participating in the HUD Homes program must maintain for each Property purchased, sold, or leased when a discount of 10 percent or greater is obtained at the time of purchase.</p>

<p>In addition, Governmental Entities and HUD-approved Nonprofits must submit a list of all business partners participating in the acquisition, rehabilitation and resale of the Property. The list must include the name of the company, the name of the principals, the name and title of all staff with whom the nonprofit is working, a description of the services provided by the company, and an accounting of the costs and fees associated with those services. This information must be reported for all real estate agents, Lenders, and contractors involved in the acquisition, rehabilitation and sale of the HUD Homes Property.</p>
<h4>(D)	HUD Homes &ndash; Net Development Costs</h4>
<p>The NDCs are composed of the allowable property Acquisition Costs plus allowable rehabilitation, holding, and selling costs which Governmental Entities and HUD-approved Nonprofits incur when purchasing HUD Homes at discounted prices, redeveloping the Properties for resale, and selling those Properties. The NDC calculation applies to all HUD Homes sold to nonprofit organizations and Governmental Entities at a 10 percent or greater discount regardless of the source of the financing (FHA, conventional Mortgage, or cash), except for discounted REO homes purchased through the Dollar Home Sales to Local Governments, Asset Control Areas (ACA), and Good Neighbor Next Door (GNND) programs.</p>
<p>The purpose of these discounts and the limits on development costs is to make housing affordable to Low- to Moderate-Income families. HUD limits the costs that are eligible to be included in the NDC calculation and prohibits the nonprofit organization or Governmental Entity from reselling the repaired or improved Properties at prices in excess of 110 percent of the NDC calculation. If the nonprofit organization's or Governmental Entity's resale price of the HUD Home exceeds 110 percent of the NDC, or if non-allowable items that are included in the NDC result in an excessive sales price, the HUD-approved Nonprofit or Governmental Entity must use the excess profit to pay down the existing Mortgage associated with that particular resale.</p>
