NPDMS is an automated web-based system designed to allow for the electronic submission of application, recertification, and reporting documentation. NPDMS collects, stores, and provides web-based access to participant applications and property activity data.</p>
<p>After submitting the preliminary information and receiving confirmation of eligibility, the applicant will be provided with login instructions to access NPDMS. FHA will not accept paper applications.</p>
<p>The nonprofit must submit a completed application within 30 Days of receiving access to NPDMS. The application date refers to the date that the application package is electronically submitted through NPDMS.</p>
<h3>v.	Processing of Application</h3>
<p>FHA will review all completed applications for approval to determine whether the nonprofit complies with all eligibility requirements. If FHA requires additional documentation or clarifying information, FHA may request such additional information and provide the nonprofit with a deadline for response. If the nonprofit does not provide the additional information requested by any specified deadline, FHA may deny approval on this basis.</p>
<h3>vi.	Incomplete Application</h3>
<p>Nonprofit agencies that submit an incomplete application package will receive a letter indicating the information required to cure the deficiency. This letter will give nonprofit agencies 15 Days from the date on the letter to correct any deficiencies. If the new nonprofit applicant does not satisfy the outstanding requirement in its entirety and within the prescribed deadlines, the approval will be denied and the nonprofit must wait an additional 90 Days before reapplying.</p>
<h3>vii.	Application Approval</h3>
<p>Nonprofit agencies that are approved for participation will be issued an approval letter from the Jurisdictional HOC describing which activities the nonprofit is approved for and any limitations associated with that approval. An approval is valid for a two-year period.</p>
<p>An approval granted by one HOC will be recognized and accepted by all other HOCs, with the exception of the AHPP. A nonprofit agency's AHPP must be separately approved by every Jurisdictional HOC for the geographic areas in which the nonprofit agency seeks to do business.</p>
<h3>viii.	Application Rejection</h3>
<p>A nonprofit&rsquo;s application may be rejected due to deficiencies or for failure to submit a program that complies with applicable regulations and requirements of this SF Handbook. Nonprofit agencies that are not approved for participation will be issued a rejection letter from the Jurisdictional HOC describing the reasons for the application rejection.</p>
<p>The nonprofit must wait 90 Days to submit a new application.</p>
