	<!-- <h3>a.	FHA Appraiser Roster</h3> -->
	<h3>i.	Definition</h3>
	<p>Appraiser refers to an FHA Roster Appraiser who observes, analyzes, and reports the physical and economic characteristics of a Property and provides an opinion of value to FHA. An Appraiser&rsquo;s observation is limited to readily observable conditions and is not as comprehensive an inspection as one performed by a licensed home inspector.</p>
	<h3>ii.	Standard</h3>
	<p>FHA requires Mortgagees to select qualified, competent and knowledgeable Appraisers.</p>
	<p>FHA maintains a list of qualified Appraisers on the <a href="https://entp.hud.gov/idapp/html/apprlook.cfm">FHA Appraiser Roster</a>. Only an Appraiser on the FHA Appraiser Roster and the Appraisal Subcommittee&rsquo;s (ASC) <a href="https://www.asc.gov/Home.aspx">National Registry</a> may be selected by the Mortgagee to conduct an appraisal for FHA-insured financing.</p>
