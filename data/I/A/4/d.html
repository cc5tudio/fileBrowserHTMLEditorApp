<h3>i.	Standard</h3>


<p>The Mortgagee must not engage an existing, legally separate mortgage company or broker to function as the MortgageeÕs branch office or DBA name or to conduct FHA activities using the MortgageeÕs FHA approval.</p>


<h3>ii.	Exception for Existing Leases</h3>


<p>In cases where a Mortgagee acquires an existing office with the intent of operating it as a branch office, and the lease of the acquired office is not transferable to the Mortgagee, FHA will allow the Mortgagee to operate the acquired office as a branch office until the lease expires upon its own terms, so long as the Mortgagee can demonstrate that it has assumed financial liability for the payment of the lease. In such cases, the Mortgagee must document and maintain evidence that it has assumed financial liability for the payment of the lease and produce this documentation to FHA upon request.</p>
