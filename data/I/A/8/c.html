<h3>i.	Standard</h3>


<p>The Mortgagee must pay an annual recertification fee after its online certification has been submitted and accepted. All fee payments must be made electronically. This recertification fee is non-refundable and will not be prorated.</p>


<h3>ii.	Calculation of Fee Amount</h3>


<p>The Mortgagee will be assessed a fee for the Mortgagee’s home office and for each branch office registered with FHA. Fees are calculated based on the Mortgagee’s program approval(s), Mortgagee type, and the number of FHA-approved branch offices as of the last business day of the Mortgagee’s annual reporting period.</p>


<p>A Mortgagee that is terminating a branch office must do so on or before the last business day of the annual reporting period in order to avoid paying the recertification fee for that branch office for the next annual period. Mortgagees attempting to terminate a branch office after the last day of their annual reporting period will not be permitted to do so until the annual recertification fees have been paid in full.</p>


<h3>iii.	Exception for Government Mortgagees</h3>


<p>Government Mortgagees are not required to pay a recertification fee.</p>
