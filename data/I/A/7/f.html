<h3>i.	Home Office</h3>


<p>If the Mortgagee is changing the geographic address of its home office to a different state, the Mortgagee must submit a Change Request to FHA through LEAP.</p>


<h3>ii.	Branch Office</h3>


<p>If the Mortgagee is changing the geographic address of a branch office to a different state, the Mortgagee must terminate the branch FHA Lender ID for the original office and register the new location as a new branch office. The branch FHA Lender ID for the original branch office will remain active for approximately 45 Days to allow for the completion of processing of Mortgages in process under that identification number.</p>


<p>Approved Mortgages that were approved before the branch office termination became effective may be endorsed. Cases at earlier stages of processing cannot be submitted for insurance by the terminated branch. However, the cases may be transferred for completion of processing and underwriting to another branch office or Mortgagee authorized to underwrite FHA-insured Mortgages in that area.</p>
