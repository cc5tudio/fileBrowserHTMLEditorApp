<p>If a Mortgagee experiences an operating loss of 20 percent or greater of its adjusted net worth, the Mortgagee must submit a Notice of Material Event to FHA within 30 business days of the loss. The 20 percent threshold applies to losses in any quarter during the fiscal year or losses that exceed 20 percent on the financial statements submitted at recertification.</p>


<p>Following the initial notification, the Mortgagee must submit financial statements every quarter until it shows an operating profit for two consecutive quarters, or until it submits its financial reports as part of its recertification.</p>
