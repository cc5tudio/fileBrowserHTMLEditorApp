<p>In order to service FHA Mortgages, an Investing Mortgagee must submit a Change Request after it has received FHA Mortgagee approval. With its Change Request, the Mortgagee must:</p>


<ul>
	<li>	designate an Officer in Charge who meets the experience requirements for the Mortgagee’s servicing function;</li>

	<li>	provide a resume for the Officer in Charge;</li>

	<li>	provide a credit report for the Officer in Charge; and</li>

	<li>	provide an updated QC Plan.</ul></li>



<p>FHA evaluates these requests on a case-by-case basis and reserves the right to request additional documents necessary to determine the Mortgagee’s servicing capabilities.</p>
