b.	Title II Mortgagee Monitoring Reviews
i.	Notice
Mortgagees are given notice prior to FHA monitoring reviews.
ii.	Production of Loan Files and Records
Mortgagees must have the files requested by FHA available for review. The Mortgagee must provide all records related to the loans selected for review, including any and all files, whether hard copy or stored, in the Mortgagee’s systems that include data or information on the specific loans identified.

FHA will, in its sole discretion, determine the scope of any monitoring review. FHA may conduct limited reviews of a Mortgagee’s origination, underwriting, and servicing of FHA-insured Single Family Mortgages, or more comprehensive reviews that include not just the Mortgagee’s files, records, and practices, but also the Mortgagee’s overall operations and policies with respect to Mortgagee relationships, quality control and risk management, escrow administration, wholesale Mortgages, and certain FHA product lines.

At the conclusion of a monitoring review, FHA will discuss Findings with the Mortgagee. FHA will provide the Mortgagee with notification of identified Findings, if any, and specify the remedies and response that are required.
