c.	Servicer Tier Ranking System II
i.	Definition
The Tier Ranking System (TRS) II is a methodology for measuring a Mortgagee’s performance in complying with HUD’s Loss Mitigation Program. 
ii.	Standard
TRS II evaluates Mortgagees’ overall performance in Delinquent mortgage servicing, based on the following elements:
•	foreclosure prevention;
•	Re-Defaults;
•	SFDMS reporting; and
•	loss mitigation engagement.
See TRS II – Scorecard Calculation Methodology – Servicer Narrative for complete instructions.
iii.	Who Will be Scored
(A)	Eligibility
HUD will score Mortgagees meeting the following criteria under TRS II:
•	approved to service Single Family Mortgages;
•	Mortgagee approval status is active; and
•	the Mortgagee is the Mortgagee of record for a seriously Delinquent portfolio of five Mortgages or more, as reflected in Neighborhood Watch for the last month in the scoring quarter.
(B)	Opt-Out Option
A Mortgagee may opt out of being rated if:
•	the Mortgagee meets the eligibility criteria above; and
•	the Mortgagee has a seriously Delinquent portfolio of between 5 and 25 Mortgages, as reflected in Neighborhood Watch for the last month of the scoring quarter.
(1)	Use of Scores
HUD will continue to issue TRS II Scorecards to all eligible Mortgagees; HUD will use scores for Mortgagees who have exercised the opt-out option for informational purposes and HUD reviews and metrics only.
(2)	Publication
HUD will not make available on a public website the scores of Mortgagees who have opted out of scoring.
(3)	Loss Mitigation Financial Incentives
Mortgagees who have opted out of scoring will not be eligible for increased loss mitigation financial incentives for the following calendar year.
(C)	Process for Opting Out
To request to opt out of scoring, the Mortgagee must submit a request to NSC via email to sfdatarequests@hud.gov, no later than October 31 of each calendar year for which the Mortgagee requests to opt out of scoring. The Mortgagee must include in the request:
•	“TRS II Opt-Out” in the subject line of their email; and
•	their Mortgagee five-digit ID number.
Once NSC verifies the Mortgagee’s status, the Mortgagee will receive a confirmation email that the Mortgagee has opted out of scoring for the fiscal year.
iv.	TRS II Elements
There are four elements that comprise TRS II:
•	Foreclosure Prevention: evaluates a Mortgagee’s foreclosure initiation actions, timeframes, and intervention practices;
•	Re-Defaults: evaluates the loss mitigation performance after a permanent Home Retention Loss Mitigation Option is utilized by the Mortgagee;
•	SFDMS Reporting: determines a Mortgagee’s compliance with Default reporting regulations; and
•	Loss Mitigation Engagement: measures a Mortgagee’s loss mitigation attempts and utilization of permanent Loss Mitigation Options.
Mortgagees may calculate their own TRS II scores by following the instructions provided in the TRS II – Scorecard Calculation Methodology – Servicer Narrative.
v.	Extra Credit 
The Mortgagee may receive extra credit added to their final fiscal year end score by attending, participating in, and/or completing delinquent servicing training pursuant to the attendance and completion requirements in the TRS II – Scorecard Calculation Methodology – Servicer Narrative.
vi.	Scores, Grades and Tiers
HUD evaluates each scoring element separately, based on activity for each month in the quarter, and then averages the elements for a quarterly score. 
HUD will provide Mortgagees with a TRS II Scorecard each quarter, along with a corresponding letter grade and tier ranking. HUD will average quarterly scores to produce a final annual fiscal year score and grade.
Final Fiscal Score	Assigned Grade	Corresponding Tier
90.00% - 100.00+%	A	1
80.00% - 89.99%	B	2
70.00% - 79.99%	C	3
60.00% - 69.99%	D	3
59.99% or Less	F	4
vii.	Notification of TRS II Scores
Mortgagees will receive quarterly TRS II Scorecards consisting of the Mortgagee’s scores, grades, and Tier via email after the conclusion of each fiscal year quarter.
HUD will only send hard copy letters containing scores, grades, and Tiers if the NSC cannot reach the Mortgagee electronically. See the TRS II – Scorecard Calculation Methodology – Servicer Narrative for information on how to request electronic distribution.
viii.	Public Availability of Scores and Grades
All scored Mortgagees, except those which have chosen to opt out, may have their names and scores published on HUD’s Tier Ranking System website at the close of each calendar year, after all appeals have been evaluated and after Mortgagees that have submitted appeals have been notified of the results.
ix.	Appeals
(A)	Basis of Appeal
The only basis for an appeal by the Mortgagee receiving an “F”/Tier 4 is disagreement with the data used by HUD to calculate the Mortgagee’s grade. If HUD determines that the Mortgagee’s “F”/Tier 4 grade rating was based on incorrect or incomplete data, HUD will recalculate the Mortgagee’s performance and will provide a corrected score. 
(B)	Timeframe
Mortgagees receiving a grade of “F”/Tier 4 may appeal their final score no later than 30 Days after the issue date of the final fiscal year grade.
(C)	Process
The Mortgagee must submit the appeal to HUD’s Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing or their designee and request an informal HUD conference.
x.	Increased Incentives
HUD will use TRS II to determine those Mortgagees earning “A”/Tier 1 scores and may therefore qualify for increased loss mitigation financial incentives for the following calendar year.
