i.	Definition
A Loan Sample Risk Assessment is a method of evaluating loans selected for QC on the basis of the severity of the violations found during QC reviews.
ii.	Standard
Mortgagees must establish a Loan Sample Risk Assessment methodology. At a minimum, the methodology must include the categories of risk described below.
The Mortgagee must compare one month’s QC sample to previous QC samples in order to conduct trend analysis.
iii.	Risk Categories

No issues or minor variances were identified with the origination, underwriting, or servicing of the Mortgage.

The Mortgagee must document the methodology used to establish the loan sample risk assessment system and conduct trend analysis.
