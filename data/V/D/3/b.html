b.	Monitoring of HUD Homes Participants
FHA’s review and monitoring activity will include a review of the AHPP and verification that HUD Homes purchased at a discount of 10 percent or greater are sold to persons at or below the applicable median income. FHA will review and monitor the program participant’s Individual Property File and Net Development Costs (NDC). The NDCs are used to review program compliance and profit margins.
FHA will also monitor to ensure that savings under the HUD Homes program are passed on to Low- to Moderate-Income Borrowers.
The HOC may request access to properties under development or otherwise a part of the nonprofit agency’s AHPP.
