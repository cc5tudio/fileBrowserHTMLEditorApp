The Mortgagee may modify the Mortgage to decrease the mortgage term by increasing the monthly payment so long as all of the following conditions are met:
•	The Mortgagee has received HUD approval.
•	The Mortgage is current and the Borrower’s payment history is satisfactory to the Mortgagee.
•	The Mortgagee has determined that the higher monthly payment is within the Borrowers’ ability to pay under the underwriting standards in Origination through Post-Closing/Endorsement.
