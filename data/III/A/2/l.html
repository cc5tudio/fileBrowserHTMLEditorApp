l.	Home Disposition Options
i.	Definition 
Home Disposition Options are the Loss Mitigation Options of PFS and DIL. 
ii.	Pre-Foreclosure Sales
(A)	Definitions
A Pre-Foreclosure Sale (PFS), also known as a Short Sale, refers to the sale of real estate that generates proceeds that are less than the amount owed on the Property and the lien holders agree to release their liens and forgive the deficiency balance on the real estate. There are three types of PFS transactions:
•	Streamlined PFS; 
•	Streamlined PFS for Servicemembers with Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Orders; and
•	Standard PFS.
(B)	Eligibility
(1)	Defaulted Mortgage Status
The Mortgagee may consider the PFS Option for Borrowers who are in Default or who are current but facing Imminent Default. The Borrower need not be in Default for Mortgagee approval of the PFS option; however, on the date the PFS closing occurs, the Mortgagee must ensure that the Mortgage is in Default status (minimum 31 Days Delinquent).
(2)	Borrower Eligibility
(a)	Streamlined PFS
(i)	Definition

(iii)	Eligible Properties
The Mortgagee may offer the Streamlined PFS process for all Properties securing FHA-insured Mortgages, provided that all Borrowers meet all program requirements. Such Properties may be vacant but cannot be condemned.
(b)	Streamlined PFS for Servicemembers with PCS Orders
(i)	Definition
A Streamlined PFS for Servicemembers with PCS Orders is a Streamlined PFS that may be offered to servicemembers who must relocate to a new duty station at least 50 miles away from their existing residence, without the Mortgagee verifying hardship.
(ii)	Streamlined PFS for Servicemembers with PCS Orders Standards
The Mortgagee must ensure that servicemembers meet the following requirements for a Streamlined PFS for Servicemembers with PCS Orders:

The Mortgagee may offer the Streamlined PFS process for all Properties securing FHA-insured Mortgages, provided that all Borrowers meet all program requirements. Such Properties may be vacant, but cannot be condemned.
(c)	Standard PFS
(i)	Definition 
A Standard PFS Option is a PFS Option available for Owner-Occupant Borrowers who are experiencing a hardship affecting their ability to sustain their Mortgage, as determined by the Deficit Income Test (DIT) and:
•	are in Default; or
•	are current or less than 30 Days past due but facing Imminent Default due to a hardship as described in the Eligible Borrowers section. 
(ii)	Standard PFS Standards
The Mortgagee must first assess whether the Borrower meets the requirements of a Streamlined PFS Option, prior to reviewing the Borrower for a Standard PFS.
(iii)	Eligible Properties
The Mortgagee may offer the Standard PFS process for all owner-occupied Properties securing FHA-insured Mortgages, provided that all Borrowers meet all program requirements. 
(iv)	Eligible Borrowers
The Mortgagee may consider for Standard PFS transactions those Borrowers in Default or in Imminent Default due to one or more of the following hardships:

(v)	Required Imminent Default Documentation
When approving a Borrower for a Standard PFS based on the Borrower’s Imminent Default for one of the reasons listed in the Eligible Borrowers section above, the Mortgagee’s Claim Review File must include the following:
•	evidence of the Borrower’s Imminent Default hardship(s); and
•	evidence that the DIT results in a negative value.
(vi)	Required Financial Documentation for Standard PFS
Prior to approving a Borrower for a Standard PFS, the Mortgagee must obtain the following documentation of the Borrower’s finances:
•	for DIT, at least one of the following: 
o	at least two of the Borrower’s most recent pay stubs or, if self-employed, the most recent quarterly or year-to-date profit and loss statement, compiled by a Certified Public Accountant (CPA);
o	the Borrower’s Social Security Income (SSI) statements and/or disability payment statements, if applicable; or
o	the Borrower’s most recent Form W-2, Form 1099, or federal tax return; and
•	for Cash Reserve contribution calculations, all of the following: 
o	the three most recent monthly bank statement(s);
o	the three most recent months of brokerage statement(s); and
o	the most recent federal tax return at the time the Borrower requests an approval for a Standard PFS.
(vii)	Deficit Income Test for Standard PFS
Definition
The Deficit Income Test (DIT) is a financial analysis test used for Standard PFS transactions to determine if a Borrower can sustain their Mortgage. 
Verification of Income and Expenses
For Standard PFS transactions, to determine a Borrower’s income and expenses for the DIT, the Mortgagee must:
•	verify the Borrower’s monthly net income by obtaining one of the following:
o	at least two of the Borrower’s most recent pay stubs or, if self-employed, the most recent quarterly or year-to-date profit and loss statement, compiled by a CPA;
o	the Borrower’s SSI statements and/or disability payment statements, if applicable; or
o	the Borrower’s most recent Form W-2, Form 1099, or federal tax return; and
•	verify the Borrower’s monthly expenses by ensuring that all expenses on the Borrower’s credit report are factored into the DIT along with any other expenses that are supported by bills, payment receipts, and/or the standard payment amounts under an IRS Index (such as the IRS Collection Financial Standards). For large past-due balances or for accounts included in bankruptcy proceedings, the Mortgagee should refer to the minimum monthly payment required prior to the delinquency when using the DIT.
DIT Calculation
In performing the DIT, the Mortgagee subtracts the Borrower’s total monthly expenses from the total monthly net income. 
DIT Results
A DIT yielding a negative amount indicates that the Borrower’s expenses exceed their income each month and thus a PFS may be an appropriate Loss Mitigation Option for the Borrower.
The Mortgagee must review a Borrower with a positive DIT amount for Loss Mitigation Home Retention Options, unless that Borrower was previously denied for those options or if that Borrower qualifies for a Streamlined Option. 
(viii)	Exceptions for Non-Owner Occupants in Standard PFS Transactions
HUD authorizes Mortgagees to grant exceptions to Non-Occupant Borrowers when the following can be demonstrated:
•	need to vacate: the non-occupancy was related to the cause of Default; and
•	not purchased/used as rental: the subject Property was not purchased as a rental or used as a rental for more than 18 months prior to the Borrower’s acceptance into the PFS Program.
(d)	Corporations or Partnerships Requesting PFS Option
The Mortgagee must submit a variance request to use the PFS Option to the NSC via EVARS when the Property is owned by a corporation or partnership.
(3)	Property Condition
(a)	Surchargeable Damage 
(i)	Definition
Surchargeable Damage is damage to a Property caused by fire, flood, earthquake, tornado, boiler explosion (for condominiums only) or Mortgagee Neglect.
(ii)	Standard 
The Mortgagee is responsible for the cost of Surchargeable Damage.
(iii)	PFS Request for Damaged Property
The Mortgagee must request NSC approval via EVARS before approving the use of the PFS Option for a Property with Surchargeable Damage as follows:
•	The Mortgagee must first obtain the Government’s Estimate of the Cost to Repair the Surchargeable Damage by contacting HUD’s Mortgagee Compliance Manager (MCM).
•	Upon receipt of the Government’s Estimate of the Cost to Repair, the Mortgagee must submit form HUD-90041, Request for Variance: Pre-foreclosure Sale Procedure, via EVARS to obtain NSC approval prior to entering into a PFS Agreement with the Borrower. The Mortgagee must note on the variance request the specific reason for the request and attach any supporting documents needed for the NSC’s review. 
(iv)	“As-Is” Subject to Surchargeable Damage
If the Property is being sold “As Is” subject to the Surchargeable Damage, the Mortgagee must deduct the Government’s Repair Cost Estimate of the damage from its PFS Claim.
(v)	“As Repaired” Subject to Surchargeable Damage
If the Property is being sold “As Repaired” and funds for surchargeable repairs will be escrowed or provided as a credit to the Borrower at closing, the Mortgagee must not include in its Net Sale Proceeds calculation the amount of the repair escrow or repair credit.
(b)	Damage other than Surchargeable Damage 
If the damage is not considered Surchargeable Damage, the Mortgagee is not required to obtain NSC approval prior to approving the PFS Agreement. 
(c)	Hazard Insurance Claim 
Where applicable, the Mortgagee must work with the Borrower to file a hazard insurance claim and either: 
•	use the proceeds to repair the Property; or 
•	adjust the PFS Claim by the amount of the insurance settlement (Non-Surchargeable Damage) or the Government’s Repair Cost Estimate.
(d)	Disclosure of Damage after PFS Approval
In the event the Mortgagee becomes aware that the Property has sustained significant damage after a Borrower has received the Approval to Participate in the PFS Program, the Mortgagee must re-evaluate the Property to determine if it continues to qualify for the PFS Program or terminate participation if the extent of the damage changes the Property’s Fair Market Value (FMV).
(4)	Condition of Title
The Mortgagee must ensure that all FHA-insured mortgaged Properties sold under the PFS Program have marketable title.
Before approving a Borrower for participation in the PFS program, the Mortgagee must obtain a title search or preliminary report verifying that the title is not impaired by:
•	unresolvable title problems; or 
•	junior liens that cannot be discharged as permitted by HUD.
(C)	PFS Outreach Requirements
(1)	Form HUD-90035
When a Borrower has expressed an interest in participating in the PFS program or has been identified by the Mortgagee as a qualified candidate for the PFS Program, the Mortgagee must mail form HUD-90035, Information Sheet: Pre-foreclosure Sale Procedure, adding its toll-free or collect telephone number to the form.
(2)	Disclosure Requirements for PFS Transactions
Before approving the Borrower for the PFS Option, the Mortgagee must notify the Borrower in writing of the following:

•	If the Borrower is a servicemember, it is recommended that the Borrower obtain guidance from their employer regarding the PFS’s impact on their security clearance and employment.
(D)	Owner-Occupant Borrower Compensation

•	The Owner-Occupant Borrower who is not required to make a minimum Cash Reserve contribution may receive any remaining amount for transition or relocation assistance only. 
(2)	Use of Compensation
The Owner-Occupant Borrower may:
•	apply the entire amount of the $3,000 compensation or a portion of it to resolve junior liens; and/or
•	offset the sales transaction costs not paid by HUD (including a home warranty plan fee, costs of optional repairs, and the buyer’s closing expenses).
The Mortgagee must instruct the Closing Agent to:
•	pay the HUD relocation or transition assistance from Net Sale Proceeds; and
•	itemize on the Closing Disclosure or similar legal document any relocation or transition assistance received by HUD or from other entities.
(3)	Required Documentation

(4)	Cash Reserves Greater than the Threshold 
The Mortgagee must require the Borrower with Cash Reserves greater than the contribution threshold to contribute 20 percent of the total amount exceeding the contribution threshold towards the mortgage debt. 
The Mortgagee must not require the Borrower to contribute more than the difference between the unpaid principal balance and the appraised value of the Property.
(5)	Cash Reserves At or Below the Threshold Amount 
If the Cash Reserve calculation returns an amount at or below the contribution threshold amount, or a negative amount, the Mortgagee is not required to obtain a contribution from the Borrower in connection with the PFS transaction.

The broker/agent must not claim a sales commission on a PFS of a broker’s/agent’s own Property or that of a spouse, sibling, parent, or child.
Any conflict of interest, appearance of a conflict, or self-dealing by any of the parties to the transaction is strictly prohibited. 
(3)	Arm’s Length PFS Transaction
(a)	Definition
An Arm’s Length PFS Transaction is between two unrelated parties that is characterized by a selling price and other conditions that would prevail in an open market environment and without hidden terms or special understandings existing between any of the parties (e.g., buyer, seller, Appraiser, sales agent, Closing Agent, and Mortgagee).
(b)	Standard
The Mortgagee must ensure that the following arms-length requirements apply to parties involved in PFS transactions:
•	Any PFS proposed by the Borrower or their agent and approved by the Mortgagee must be an Arm’s Length Transaction between the Borrower and prospective buyer, subject to the exceptions in the Permitted Non-Arms-Length Transaction section.
•	Except for real estate agents and brokers representing a party to the PFS, no party that is a signatory on the sales contract, including addenda, can serve in more than one capacity.

•	determine that the Property was marketed pursuant to HUD requirements and that the minimum required Tiered Net Sale Proceeds have been met. 
The following anti-fraud measures apply to PFS transactions:
•	A Mortgagee must not approve a Borrower for a PFS if the Mortgagee knows or has reason to know of a Borrower’s fraud or misrepresentation of information.
•	All parties involved in a PFS transaction must sign and date a PFS Addendum as a contingency for a PFS transaction to close.
(2)	Sales Contract Review Period
After receiving an executed Contract of Sale from the Borrower, the Mortgagee must send to the Borrower form HUD-90051, Sales Contract Review, no later than five business days from the Mortgagee’s receipt of an executed Contract for Sale.
(3)	Net Sale Proceeds
(a)	Definition
Net Sale Proceeds are the proceeds of a PFS sale, calculated by subtracting reasonable and customary closing and settlement costs from the property sales price.
(b)	Standard
Regardless of the Property’s sale price, a Mortgagee may only approve a PFS Contract for Sale if the Tiered Net Sale Proceeds are at or above HUD’s minimum allowable thresholds. HUD’s requirements for minimum Tiered Net Sale Proceeds, as based on the length of time a Property has been competitively marketed for sale under an Approval to Participate, are as follows:
•	First 30 Days of marketing: The Mortgagee may only approve offers that will result in minimum Net Sale Proceeds of 88 percent of the “as-is” appraised FMV. 
•	Next 30 Days of marketing: The Mortgagee may only approve offers that will result in minimum Net Sale Proceeds of 86 percent of the “as-is” appraised FMV.
•	For the remaining duration of the PFS marketing period: The Mortgagee may only approve offers that will result in minimum Net Sale Proceeds of 84 percent of the “as-is” appraised FMV.
The Mortgagee has the discretion to deny or delay sales where an offer may meet or exceed the 84 percent, if it is presumed that continued marketing would likely produce a higher sale amount.
The Mortgagee is liable for any FHA Insurance Claim Overpayment on a PFS transaction that closes with less than the required Tiered Net Sale Proceeds, unless a variance has been granted by HUD.
(c)	Settlement Costs 
(i)	Allowable Settlement Costs
The Mortgagee may include the following settlement costs in its Net Sale Proceeds calculation:
•	sales commission consistent with the prevailing rate but, not to exceed 6 percent;

•	local/state transfer tax stamps and other closing costs customarily paid by the seller, including the seller’s costs for a Title Search and Owner’s Title Insurance;
•	compensation payable to the Owner-Occupant Borrower of $3,000, if not required to pay a cash contribution;
•	upon extinguishing the Owner-Occupant Borrower’s compensation of $3,000, HUD will allow an additional $1,500 of Net Sale Proceeds to be used to resolve junior liens, for a total of $4,500;
•	for Non-Occupant Borrowers, HUD will allow $1,500 of Net Sale Proceeds to be used to resolve junior liens;
•	the entire outstanding Partial Claim amount must be paid when calculating the Net Sale Proceeds. The seller, buyer, or other Interested Party may contribute the difference if the amount of Net Sale Proceeds falls below the allowable threshold; and
•	up to 1 percent of the buyer’s first mortgage amount if the sale includes FHA financing.
(ii)	Unacceptable Settlement Costs
The Mortgagee must not include the following costs in the Net Sale Proceeds calculation:

With the exception of reasonable and customary real estate commissions, the Mortgagee must ensure that third-party fees incurred by the Mortgagee or Borrower to negotiate a PFS are not included on the Closing Disclosure or similar legal documents unless explicitly permitted by state law.
The Mortgagee, its agents, or any outsourcing firm it employs must not charge any fee to the Borrower for participation in the PFS Program.
(e)	Partial Claim
The Mortgagee must ensure that all outstanding Partial Claims are paid in full. 
The Mortgagee must deduct any outstanding balance on a Partial Claim Note from the Net Sale Proceeds. The Mortgagee must send proceeds from the PFS sufficient to satisfy the Partial Claim directly to HUD’s Loan Servicing Contractor. 
If, after satisfying the Partial Claim, the Net Sale Proceeds fail to meet the applicable Tiered Net Sale Proceeds requirement, the Mortgagee must request and obtain approval from HUD via EVARS before closing. 
(4)	Title I Liens
If the Mortgagee discovers that a Borrower has a HUD Title I Mortgage secured by the Property, the Mortgagee must contact the Title I subordinate lien holder to advise of the Borrower’s participation in a PFS. HUD may require the Mortgagee to negotiate the release of the lien in order to proceed with a PFS.
If the Title I Mortgage has been assigned to HUD, the Mortgagee must contact HUD’s Financial Operations Center for guidance:
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
Financial Operations Center
52 Corporate Circle
Albany, New York 12203. 
1-800-669-5152/ fax (518) 862-2806
(5)	Section 235 Recapture
The Mortgagee must first determine if the Mortgage is subject to recapture as referenced in Section 235 Mortgages. If a recapture amount is owed to HUD, the Mortgagee must contact HUD’s Servicing Contractor prior to approving the PFS.

•	only allowable settlement costs have been deducted from the seller’s proceeds;
•	the Net Sale Proceeds will be equal to or greater than the allowable thresholds; 
•	form HUD-90052 is included in the Claim Review File; and
•	they report the PFS Sale to consumer reporting agencies.

•	pay the expenses out of the Net Sale Proceeds and forward the Net Sale Proceeds to the Mortgagee;
•	forward a copy of the Closing Disclosure or similar legal document to the Mortgagee to be included in the Claim Review File no later than three business days after the PFS transaction closes; and
•	sign the PFS Addendum on or before the date the PFS transaction closes, unless explicitly prohibited by state statute.
(3)	Satisfaction of Mortgage Debt
Upon receipt of the portion of the Net Sale Proceeds designated for mortgage satisfaction, the Mortgagee must satisfy the Mortgage debt and may file a claim for mortgage insurance benefits.

•	If no other sources are available, both the Owner-Occupant Borrower and the Non-Occupant Borrower may obligate up to an additional $1,500 from sale proceeds towards discharging liens or encumbrances.
(L)	Early Termination of PFS Program Participation
(1)	Standard 
(a)	Borrower-Initiated Termination 
The Mortgagee must permit a Borrower to voluntarily terminate participation in the PFS Program at any time. 
(b)	Mortgagee-Initiated Termination 
The Mortgagee may terminate a Borrower’s PFS Program participation at its discretion for any of the following reasons:
•	discovery of unresolvable title problems;
•	determination that the Borrower is not acting in good faith to market the Property;
•	significant change in property condition or value; or
•	re-evaluation based on new financial information provided by the Borrower that indicates that the case does not qualify for the PFS Option.
(c)	Notification of PFS Program Participation Termination
The Mortgagee must forward to the Borrower a date-stamped written explanation for terminating their program participation. This letter is to include the “end-of-participation” date for the Borrower.
(2)	Required Documentation
The Mortgagee must retain a copy of the Notification of PFS Program Participation Termination in the servicing file. 
(M)	Failure to Complete a PFS Transaction
At the expiration of the PFS marketing period, should the Borrower be unable to complete a PFS transaction, the Mortgagee must re-evaluate available Loss Mitigation Options as follows:
•	determining eligibility for one of the Loss Mitigation Home Retention Options, if the Borrower’s financial condition has improved to the point that reinstatement is a viable option; and
•	trying to obtain a DIL of Foreclosure, if reinstatement is not feasible.
Within 90 Days after the expiration of the PFS marketing period, the Mortgagee must consider and approve the Borrower for an alternate Loss Mitigation Option or complete the first legal action to initiate foreclosure.
Should additional time be needed to complete a DIL or to initiate foreclosure, Mortgagees must submit a request for an extension of time to the NSC via EVARS.
(N)	Extensions of Foreclosure Timeframe for PFS
(1)	Standard
After PFS early termination or option failure, HUD provides an automatic 90-Day extension to the deadline to complete a Loss Mitigation Option or to perform the first legal action initiating foreclosure. The automatic 90-Day extension begins the Day after the PFS Approval to Participate expires or is terminated.
If the Mortgagee has not yet received the Net Sale Proceeds from the Closing Agent and the automatic 90-Day extension is nearing expiration, the Mortgagee must submit a request for extension to the NSC via EVARS.
(2)	Required Documentation
The Mortgagee must note the use of any extensions, whether automatic or requested, on form HUD-27011.
(O)	Deficiency Judgments
If a foreclosure occurs after the Borrower unsuccessfully participated in the PFS process in good faith, neither the Mortgagee nor HUD will pursue the Borrower for a deficiency Judgment.
(P)	PFS Incentive
The Mortgagee may claim an incentive for each completed PFS transaction that complies with all HUD PFS requirements.
(Q)	Mortgage Insurance Termination
The Mortgagee must not submit a mortgage insurance termination on PFS transactions. HUD can only pay FHA mortgage insurance benefits when the status of the mortgage insurance is “active.”
(R)	Reporting of PFS 
The Mortgagee must report in SFDMS the appropriate Claim Termination of Insurance Code to indicate when the PFS has been held. 
iii.	Deed-in-Lieu of Foreclosure
(A)	Definition
A Deed-in-Lieu (DIL) of Foreclosure is a Loss Mitigation Home Disposition Option in which a Borrower voluntarily offers the deed as collateral Property to HUD in exchange for a release from all obligations under the Mortgage. There are three types of DIL transactions:

(ii)	Standard DIL Standard
Borrowers applying for the Standard DIL Option must provide verification of hardship and must submit a Complete Loss Mitigation Request for review. The Mortgagee must evaluate the Borrower’s financial information to determine whether the Borrower’s financial circumstances have changed to make them eligible for other Loss Mitigation Options.

•	Need to vacate: the non-occupancy was related to the cause of Default; or
•	Not purchased/used as rental: the subject Property was not purchased as a rental or used as a rental for more than 18 months prior to the offering of the DIL Option.
The Mortgagee must submit a variance request to use the DIL Option to the NSC via EVARS when the Property is owned by a corporation or partnership.

•	The Mortgage must be in Default on the date the DIL special warranty deed is executed, pursuant to Section 204 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1710).
•	DIL transactions are generally reported to consumer reporting agencies, and will likely affect the Borrower’s ability to obtain another Mortgage and other types of credit.
•	If the Borrower is a servicemember, it is recommended that the Borrower obtain guidance from their employer regarding the DIL’s impact on their security clearance and employment.
•	DIL transactions are generally reported to CAIVRS, which may result in the Borrower’s inability to obtain government financing or affect other government benefits for a certain period of time.
(D)	Cash Reserve Contributions for Standard DIL Transactions
(1)	Standard
Prior to approving a Borrower to participate in a Standard DIL transaction, the Mortgagee must calculate and disclose to the Borrower the amount of the Borrower’s Cash Reserve contribution to be applied towards the Standard DIL transaction. HUD does not require Cash Reserve contributions for Streamlined DIL transactions. 
The Mortgagee must calculate the total Cash Reserves using the highest ending balance of each cash reserve asset.
(2)	Cash Reserve Contribution Threshold 
The Cash Reserve contribution threshold is $5,000.
(3)	Cash Reserves Greater than the Threshold 
The Mortgagee must require the Borrower with Cash Reserves greater than the contribution threshold to contribute 20 percent of the total amount exceeding the contribution threshold towards the mortgage debt. 
The Mortgagee must not require the Borrower to contribute more than the difference between the unpaid principal balance and the appraised value of the Property. If the appraisal used for the PFS program is no longer valid, the Mortgagee may use the most recently obtained appraisal for the purpose of calculating the Cash Reserve contribution. 
(4)	Cash Reserves At or Below the Threshold Amount 
If the Cash Reserve calculation returns an amount at or below the contribution threshold amount, or a negative amount, the Mortgagee is not required to obtain a contribution from the Borrower in connection with the DIL transaction.
(E)	DIL Borrower Consideration
(1)	Consideration Amount 
HUD offers Owner-Occupant Borrowers a consideration of up to $2,000 upon vacating the Property and satisfaction of the requirements of the DIL Agreement. HUD will not pay this consideration if the Property is occupied at conveyance.
(2)	Use of Consideration Amount 
The Owner-Occupant Borrower may apply the entire amount of the consideration or a portion of it to resolve junior liens. 
The Owner-Occupant Borrower who is required to make a Cash Reserve contribution may only receive the amount necessary to satisfy junior liens, up to the consideration limit.
(F)	DIL Agreement

•	The Mortgagee must complete a title search and must ensure that the secure release of junior liens and/or endorsements to the title policy are obtained. 
•	HUD will not accept titles subject to most junior liens, including IRS liens. HUD will allow liens securing repayment of Section 235 assistance payments, Partial Claim advances, and Title I liens.
•	If the Owner-Occupant Borrower receives consideration, this consideration may be applied towards discharging liens.
(3)	Special Warranty Deed
The Borrower and the Mortgagee must convey the Property through a special warranty deed and, when possible, the Borrower must convey title directly to HUD. The Mortgagee must cancel and surrender to the Borrower the original credit instrument, indicating that the Mortgage has been satisfied.

The Mortgagee may submit a claim for an incentive for each completed DIL transaction that complies with all HUD DIL requirements.
(I)	Extensions for Foreclosure Timeframes
The Mortgagee must complete the DIL or initiate foreclosure within six months of the date of Default as follows, unless the Mortgagee qualified for an automatic 90-Day extension by first attempting a Loss Mitigation Option or has received an extension approved by the NSC via EVARS:
