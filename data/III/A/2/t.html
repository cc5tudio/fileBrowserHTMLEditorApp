(B)	HUD Contact
(1)	Mortgagee Compliance Manager
HUD’s MCM is the single point of contact to administer Mortgagee compliance functions and property preservation activities.
(2)	P260
P260 is HUD’s web-based internet portal, which allows Mortgagees to submit requests, notifications, and documents and obtain approvals for pre- and post-conveyance activities.
(C)	Mortgagee Property Preservation and Protection Action
(1)	Definition
Property Preservation and Protection (P&P) actions are maintenance, security, and repair work required by HUD in order to ensure that the Property meets HUD’s conveyance condition standards.
Mortgagee Neglect is the Mortgagee’s failure to take action to preserve and protect the Property from the time it is determined (or should have been determined) to be vacant or abandoned, until the time it is conveyed to HUD. 
(2)	Standard
The Mortgagee must preserve and protect Properties that are the security for FHA-insured Mortgages that are in Default or presently in foreclosure. The Mortgagee is responsible for the management, scheduling, and execution of all activities and actions taken to preserve, secure, maintain and protect the Property, regardless of the amount that HUD may reimburse. The Mortgagees may use any qualified individual or business to perform P&P services on Properties that were secured by FHA-insured Mortgages; however, the Mortgagee remains fully responsible to HUD for its actions and the actions of its agents, individuals and firms that performed such services.
The Mortgagee remains responsible for property damage or destruction to vacant or abandoned Property resulting from Mortgagee Neglect. Such neglect includes, but is not limited to:
•	failure to adequately and accurately verify the occupancy status of a Property;
•	failure to complete timely and accurate property inspections;
•	failure to promptly and appropriately secure and to continue to preserve and protect all vacant Properties according to HUD standards; and
•	failure to promptly notify the Mortgagee Compliance Manager (MCM) of receipt of code violations and demolition notices and/or take appropriate action.
To ensure that the Mortgagee is not held liable for damage to the Property by waste committed by the Borrower, their heirs, successors, or assigns, the Mortgagee must document and photograph any damage resulting from the Borrower that is identified during the First-Time Vacant (FTV) securing of the Property.
(3)	Required Documentation
The Mortgagee must:
•	take before and after photographs and upload them into P260 for each claimed Property P&P expense; 
•	document and photograph any damage resulting from the Borrower that is identified using the FTV inspection; and
•	retain in the Claim Review File:
o	all copies of paid invoices or receipts or other documentation supporting all property preservation expenses claimed by the Mortgagee; and
o	a chronology of the Mortgagee’s Property P&P actions.
If documentation is incomplete, inadequate, or not provided, HUD will not accept a Mortgagee’s certification of property condition and may:
•	re-convey the Property to the Mortgagee; or
•	seek reimbursement from the Mortgagee for HUD’s estimate of the cost of the repairs required to repair and restore the Property to conveyance condition.
HUD will require repayment of all or part of any claim reimbursement if it is determined that expenses claimed and paid were unnecessary or excessive, or that services claimed were not performed or were performed improperly or incompletely.
(4)	Property Preservation Allowances 
(a)	Definition
The Maximum Property Preservation Allowance is a pre-approved reimbursement for the aggregate of all property preservation expenses that do not exceed the line item allowable amounts listed in HUD’s Property Preservation Allowances and Schedules. 
(b)	Standard
The Maximum Property Preservation Allowance is $5,000 per Property.
(c)	Requests for Exceeding Property Preservation Allowances

•	the aggregate of all Property P&P expenses exceed the Maximum Property Preservation Allowance;
•	a Property P&P cost will exceed the maximum line item allowance listed in the Property Preservation Allowances schedule; or 
•	there is no specific line item allowable stated in the schedule for the expense.
When the Mortgagee submits an over-allowable request to exceed the Maximum Property Preservation Allowance, the Mortgagee must demonstrate their incurred P&P costs are at or near the Maximum Property Preservation Allowance. 
(ii)	Required Documentation
The Mortgagee must upload all supporting documentation into P260, including a detailed description of what actions will be or were taken, an itemized list of the repairs and materials that will be or were used, relevant room dimensions, receipts, and photographs, and a chronological listing of all Property P&P expenses incurred before submittal of the over-allowable expense request.
The following chart details requirements for over-allowable requests.
If Claimed Property Preservation Expenses are:	And the Cost of a Single Line Item Expense is:	Need Over-allowable Approval?
$5,000 or less	Greater than Appendix A	Yes
$5,000 or less	Less than Appendix A	No
Greater than $5,000	Greater than Appendix A	Yes
Greater than $5,000	Less than Appendix A	Yes
(d)	Appeals of Over-Allowable Request Decisions
The Mortgagee may appeal an initial over-allowable decision via P260, for review by the MCM.
The Mortgagee may submit an additional appeal to the MCM via P260, who will review the appeal and, at its discretion, approve or deny the appeal or determine if further review by HUD is needed. HUD’s or the MCM’s decision on the second appeal is final and no further appeals will be accepted.
(5)	Property P&P Requirements of Authorities Having Jurisdiction
(a)	Definition
An Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) refers to a state or local government, HOA, or other organization responsible for enforcing the requirements of a property-related code or standard including state law and local ordinance.
(b)	Standard
Mortgagees are not exempt by HUD policy from adhering to state and local laws relating to the P&P of Properties securing FHA-insured Mortgages. 
The Mortgagee must review the AHJ requirements, including those relating to occupancy of the Structures, to determine applicability for repair or remediation prior to conveyance of the Property to HUD.
Where state or local law inhibits the Mortgagee performing HUD’s required Property (P&P) actions, such as connecting or disconnecting utilities, the Mortgagee must send the MCM notice of the restriction on the Property P&P action and a proposal on how the Mortgagee will otherwise protect the Property from damage.
Where the AHJ requires additional or more extensive P&P actions than required by HUD for conveyance, the Mortgagee may submit an over-allowable request via P260. The Mortgagee must upload with its request all documentation supporting the proposed additional work requirements and expenses necessary for compliance.
(c)	Required Documentation
Where state or local law inhibits the Mortgagee performing HUD’s required Property (P&P) actions, the Mortgagee must note the restriction in the Claim Review File and include a copy of the notice to the MCM, the MCM’s approval or denial of the Mortgagee’s proposal, and the applicable state, local, or AHJ requirement.
