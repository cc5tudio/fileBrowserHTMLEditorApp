i.	Loss Mitigation Review Process
i.	Servicemember Status
The Mortgagee must offer eligible servicemember Borrowers mortgage protections under the SCRA and Servicing FHA-Insured Mortgages for Servicemember-Borrowers.

(A)	Definition
A Complete Loss Mitigation Request is a request for loss mitigation assistance that contains all information the Mortgagee requires from the Borrower in order to evaluate Loss Mitigation Options.
(B)	Standard
The Mortgagee must timely evaluate and respond to Complete Loss Mitigation Requests. For loss mitigation requests received after the initiation of foreclosure, the Mortgagee must evaluate and respond to Complete Loss Mitigation Requests according to the timeframe requirements in Loss Mitigation during the Foreclosure Process.
When a Mortgagee receives incomplete loss mitigation requests, the Mortgagee must notify the Borrower in writing:
•	which documents are needed for review; and
•	when the documents should be sent back to the Mortgagee.
This notice must include the required statement that the Borrower should consider contacting Mortgagees of any other Mortgages secured by the same Property to discuss available Loss Mitigation Options.
(C)	Required Documentation
The Mortgagee must note in its servicing file:
•	the dates it received a Complete Loss Mitigation Request; 
•	the dates it sent any notices to the Borrower requesting additional documentation, if applicable; and
•	what documentation was requested, if applicable. 
iii.	Evaluation of the Borrower’s Financial Condition
(A)	Borrower’s Financial Information [This section must be implemented no later than March 1, 2017]
(1)	Standard
The Mortgagee must obtain detailed financial information from the Borrower in order to evaluate them for Loss Mitigation Options. The Mortgagee may accept financial information during a telephone interview subject to confirmation with appropriate supporting documentation.
(a)	Living Expenses
The Mortgagee must confirm all Borrowers’ monthly living expenses with appropriate supporting documentation when the existing total Mortgage Payment (i.e., PITI) is equal to or less than 31 percent of the Borrowers’ current monthly gross income. The Mortgagee must ensure that all expenses on the Borrower’s credit report are included in the Mortgagee’s calculation of living expenses, along with any other expenses, which can be supported by bills and receipts or by allowances for the five necessary expenses (food, housekeeping supplies, apparel and services, personal care products and services, and miscellaneous) established as national standards for food, clothing, and other items as part of the IRS Collection Financial Standards.
Refer to IRS National Standards: Food, Clothing and Other Items for more information.
(b)	Borrower Income
For purposes of a loss mitigation analysis, Borrower income must include:
•	the income of each Borrower who is occupying or not occupying the Property; and
•	the income of each owner-occupant non-Borrower who will be added as a Borrower and assume personal liability for repayment of the Mortgage in accordance with the agreed upon loss mitigation terms.
(c)	Hardship
Hardship for purposes of FHA’s Loss Mitigation Options is demonstrated by providing evidence of an increase in living expenses or a loss of income. FHA-approved Mortgagees have the delegated authority to request the documentation they deem necessary from Borrowers to substantiate a hardship.
(2)	Required Documentation
The Mortgagee must retain documentation of financial information in the Claim Review File.
Supporting documentation for hardship can be in the form of bank statements, medical bills, home repair bills, and other similar documentation.
(B)	Analysis of Borrower’s Financial Information for Surplus Income
(1)	Definition
Surplus Income Percentage is a percentage calculated in the Mortgagee’s financial analysis to determine which Loss Mitigation Options are appropriate based on the Borrower’s income.
(2)	Standard
The Mortgagee must analyze the Borrower’s current and future ability to meet the monthly Mortgage Payment by estimating the Borrower’s assets and surplus income as follows:
•	Step 1: Estimate the Borrower’s normal monthly living expenses (e.g., food, utilities, etc.), debt service on the Mortgage, and other obligations, including Homeowners’ Association (HOA)/Condominium Fees, based on current information, and projected for:
o	a period of three months; or
o	if review is for Special Forbearance (SFB) - Unemployment Option, for the length of the SFB - Unemployment Agreement.
•	Step 2: Estimate the Borrower’s anticipated monthly net income for the same period listed above, making necessary adjustments for income fluctuations.
•	Step 3: Subtract expenses from income to determine the amount of surplus income available each month.
•	Step 4: Divide surplus income by monthly net income to determine the Surplus Income Percentage.
The Mortgagee must ensure that the selected workout strategy reflects the Borrower’s ability to pay. The Mortgagee must require Borrowers who want to retain the Property and who have sufficient surplus income and/or other assets to reinstate the Mortgage through a repayment strategy.
iv.	Continuous Income for Loss Mitigation Evaluations
(A)	Definition
Continuous Income is income received by the Borrower that is reasonably likely to continue from the date of the Mortgagee’s loss mitigation evaluation through at least the next 12 months.

•	Child Support;
•	survivor benefits;
•	Pensions; and
•	other documented income that is reasonably likely to continue from the date of the Mortgagee’s loss mitigation evaluation through at least the next 12 months.
In determining the amount of Continuous Income available to a Borrower, the Mortgagee must review the Borrower’s documented sources of income and expenses and calculate the Borrower’s surplus/deficit income or gross income necessary for applicable Loss Mitigation Options.
v.	90-Day Review Requirement
(A)	Definition
The 90-Day Review is a Mortgagee’s required evaluation, occurring before four monthly installments are due and unpaid, of a Defaulted Mortgage for appropriate Loss Mitigation Options.
(B)	Standard
To comply with this loss mitigation review requirement, the Mortgagee must:
•	contact the Borrower to gather information about their circumstances, intentions, and financial condition; and
•	attempt to complete its evaluation of the Mortgage for all appropriate Loss Mitigation Options.
After its review of a Borrower’s loss mitigation request, the Mortgagee must send a written Notice to Borrower after Loss Mitigation Review.

(B)	Required Documentation
The Mortgagee’s servicing records must include monthly notations, documenting the Mortgagee’s analysis and determination with respect to the appropriateness of each Loss Mitigation Option. If the Borrower indicates that there has been no change in their circumstances, the Mortgagee may note this in its records.
As long as the Borrower is performing on an approved Loss Mitigation Option, including Trial Payment Plans, the Mortgagee has met the monthly review requirement and must note this in the Claim Review File. 
vii.	Loss Mitigation Reporting
The Mortgagee must report in SFDMS the Delinquency Workouts Status Codes that accurately reflect the stage of loss mitigation review. 
If the Mortgagee has determined that the Borrower is ineligible for Loss Mitigation and the Mortgagee will be initiating foreclosure, the Mortgagee must report in SFDMS the appropriate Ineligible for Loss Mitigation Code.
viii.	Notice to Borrower after Loss Mitigation Review [This section must be implemented no later than March 1, 2017]
The Mortgagee must send a written notice to the Borrower after an evaluation of the Borrower for Loss Mitigation Option eligibility, which indicates:

•	the actual reason or reasons they have been denied for any HUD Loss Mitigation Option;
•	the process for appeals or escalation of cases; 
•	the process and timeframe for submission of additional information that may impact the Mortgagee’s evaluation; 
•	the Mortgagee’s points of contact; and
•	the possibility of the Borrower’s Mortgage being included in a Single Family Loan Sale or being foreclosed upon if loss mitigation is not viable, unsuccessful, denied, or unable to be considered (due to the Borrower’s failure to fully respond to the Mortgagee’s request for additional information).

(D)	Electronic Signatures
The use of electronic signatures is voluntary. HUD will accept an electronic signature conducted in accordance with the Policy on Use of Electronic Signatures on HUD Loss Mitigation documents requiring signatures, unless otherwise prohibited by law.
(E)	No Waiver of Rights

(A)	Standard
The Mortgagee must comply with and seek relief, if appropriate, from the automatic stay.
