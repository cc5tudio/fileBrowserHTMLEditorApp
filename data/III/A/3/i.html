i.	Nehemiah Housing Opportunity Grants Program
Title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 established the Nehemiah Housing Opportunity Grants Program (NHOP), which authorized HUD to make grants to nonprofit organizations enabling them to provide Mortgages to families purchasing homes constructed or substantially rehabilitated in accordance with a HUD-approved program. The program was funded by Congress in 1989, 1990, and 1991. It is no longer an active program as grant funds were exhausted in April 1991. HUD’s Servicing Contractor handles the satisfaction of liens still outstanding from this program.
