a.	Processing of Claim Forms
HUD will generate payment to the Mortgagee if:
•	the Mortgagee’s submission of Parts A and B pass all system edits and control checks; and
•	the Mortgagee provides all required documentation or makes all necessary updates to the suspended claim.
HUD may reduce the claim payment if the claim lists unusually high disbursements that are not supported by documentation. HUD may require reimbursement of any amounts that are found to be excessive or not supported by appropriate documentation.
When a Mortgagee files a claim, other than a supplemental claim or Loss Mitigation Incentive claim, after the expiration of a designated time period, HUD will accept these claims, which will be subject to interest curtailment.
i.	Initial Payment

The Initial Claim Payment is the disbursement to the Mortgagee of funds relating to Part A of form HUD-27011.
(B)	Standard
