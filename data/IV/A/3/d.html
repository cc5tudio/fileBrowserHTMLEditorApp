d.	Negative Claim Amount
If the Net Claim Amount in Part B (Item 137) of the original conveyance claim is a negative amount, HUD will calculate the claim, making the necessary adjustments for the costs of foreclosure, and will bill the Mortgagee for the amount due. For CWCOT and PFS claims, HUD will calculate the claim and issue the Mortgagee a settlement letter.
