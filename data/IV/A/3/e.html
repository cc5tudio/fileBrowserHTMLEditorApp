e.	Advice of Payment and Title Approval
When a claim is processed in the HUD Claims system, HUD will provide the Advice of Payment and Title Approval (where applicable) via FHAC. Mortgagees may locate both the Advice of Payment and Title Approval under the Single Family Insurance Claims Processing menu in the Single Family FHA/Single Family Servicing section of FHAC. Advice of Payment is available by accessing the “Claim Status” function, while Title Approval is available by accessing the “Title Approval Status” function.
When a claim is being processed outside of the HUD Claims system, HUD will provide hard copies of the Advice of Payment and Title Approval (where applicable) letters to the Mortgagee by mail.
Mortgagees should be advised that if claims have been grouped together into one EFT payment, HUD will provide Mortgagees with a separate Advice of Payment for each individual payment in each payment batch via FHAC if claims are filed electronically or via hard copy if claims are filed manually.
