ii.	Record Retention Period
The Mortgagee must retain this documentation for at least seven years after the final claim or latest supplemental claim settlement date:
•	The final settlement date is the date of the last acknowledgement or payment received by the Mortgagee in response to the submission of a claim. In certain cases, the acknowledgement may be in the form of a bill.
•	The supplemental settlement date is the date of the final payment or acknowledgement of such supplemental claim. In certain cases, the acknowledgement may be in the form of a bill.
iii.	Electronic Storage
The Mortgagee may use electronic storage methods for all other required servicing and claim-related documents where retention of a hard copy or original document is not required.
iv.	HUD Requests for Information
The Mortgagee must make available to HUD hard or electronic copies of identified claim files within 24 hours of a request, or as otherwise requested by HUD. HUD may charge a fee for the review of a Claim Review File that is not provided to HUD when requested.
v.	Missing Claim Files
If the Mortgagee is unable to produce the Claim Review File at HUD’s request during the record retention period, HUD may consider all amounts for expenses and interest to have been paid in error.
