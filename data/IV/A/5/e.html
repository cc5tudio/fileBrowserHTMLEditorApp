e.	Notification to Mortgagee of Claim Review
HUD will notify Mortgagees by letter before beginning its claims review. The Mortgagee must make available to HUD copies of identified claim files, in the format (electronic or hard copy) requested, within 24 hours of a request or such other time as permitted by HUD.
Denial of access to a file may be grounds for enforcement action.
