b.	Standard
HUD or its agent may conduct a post-claim review at any time within three years after the claim is paid. This timeframe does not apply to or limit enforcement reviews.
The Mortgagee must be able to show support for all information entered on the application for insurance benefits. If a question arises regarding the support of an amount reimbursed on an insurance claim, the burden of proof is on the Mortgagee to show that the amount is valid and reasonable. If the mortgagee is notified within the three-year period that its claims will be reviewed by HUD or its agent, all claim files must be maintained until completion and final settlement of the review.
