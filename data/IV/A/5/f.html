f.	HUD’s Initial Report
HUD will review the result of the claims review prior to the issuance of a report.
After completion of the reviews, HUD will issue the initial report identifying:
•	any discrepancies resulting from inaccuracies, omissions, missed time requirements or unsupported claim information;
•	the Mortgagee’s potential liability (potential amount owed); and
•	whether or not the Mortgagee is in compliance with HUD’s claim filing guidelines.
