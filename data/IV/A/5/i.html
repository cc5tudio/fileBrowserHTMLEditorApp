i.	Mortgagee Response Procedures to HUD’s Follow-Up Report
Within 21 Days from the date of the follow-up report, the Mortgagee may provide additional documentation that could affect the review results. If no additional documentation is provided within 21 Days, HUD will consider the report final and the potential liability identified will become the amount owed.
If further documentation is submitted to refute the Findings in the follow-up report, HUD will review the documentation and issue a final report stating:
•	the revised Findings (if any);
•	any new Findings; and
•	that the review is being referred to the Albany Financial Operations Center (FOC) for enforced debt collection, if applicable.
