d.	Frequency of Reviews
HUD may review any paid claim file at any time within three years after the claim is paid.
Where state Housing Finance Agencies (HFA) have settled 50 or fewer FHA mortgage insurance claims in a 12-month period, the HFA may elect to defer the review to a biennial (occurring every two years) schedule.
