(b)	Mortgages Endorsed for FHA Insurance On or Before January 23, 2004
For Mortgages that were insured on or before January 23, 2004 and were not Direct Endorsements, the Mortgagee must calculate the debenture interest rate as the higher of the rates in effect on:
•	the date the Mortgage was endorsed for insurance; or
•	the date of Firm Commitment.
(c)	Direct Endorsements and Coinsurance Programs
(i)	Mortgages Endorsed for FHA Insurance After January 23, 2004
For applications involving Mortgages originated under the Single Family Direct Endorsement Program and endorsed for FHA insurance after January 23, 2004, the Mortgagee must calculate the debenture interest rate as the monthly average yield for the month in which the Default on the Mortgage occurred, on United States Treasury Securities adjusted to a constant maturity of 10 years.
(ii)	Mortgages Insured On or Before January 23, 2004
For Direct Endorsement Mortgages insured on or prior to January 23, 2004, the Mortgagee must calculate debenture interest as the rate in effect on the date the Mortgage was endorsed for insurance.
(2)	Time Frames for Debenture Interest

(i)	Definition
The Date of Initial Claim Settlement is the date that HUD approves the settlement of Part A of form HUD-27011 for payment.
The Date of Final Claim Settlement is the date that HUD approves the settlement of Part B of form HUD-27011 for payment.
(ii)	Standard
Part A
Provided that the Mortgagee has met all time requirements, HUD will pay debenture interest on the unpaid principal balance from the date of Default to the date of initial claim settlement.
Part B
HUD will compute interest on expenditures from the date of the submission of Part B to the date of the final claim settlement.
(b)	Interest up to Disbursement Date
(i)	Definition
The Disbursement Date, as applicable to claims, is the date the Mortgagee paid for an expense.
(ii)	Standard
For each Disbursement itemized on Parts C, D and E, the Mortgagee must compute the debenture interest from the latter of the Disbursement Date or date of Default, to the earlier date of when Part B is prepared or Part A’s date of interest curtailment.
(iii)	Required Documentation
The Mortgagee must enter in Item 204 (Part C) and Item 304 (Part D) the date to which interest is calculated for expenditures claimed on form HUD-27011, Part B. This will be the same date as entered in Item 104, Part B, provided no time requirement or approved extension has been missed.
(B)	Calculating Interest for an Expenditure using Daily Interest Rate Factors
(1)	Definition
The Daily Interest Rate Factor is the annual interest rate expressed as a decimal, divided by 365 (or 366 in leap years), and rounded to the fourth place to the right of the decimal, for the purpose of calculating interest on claimed expenditures.
(2)	Standard
The Mortgagee must calculate the amount of interest to be claimed for an expenditure as follows:
•	identify the effective debenture interest rate based on the endorsement date of the mortgage for mortgages endorsed before January 23, 2004, or the date of Default for mortgages endorsed on or after January 23, 2004;
•	find the Daily Interest Rate Factor (see Appendix 8.c Daily Interest Rate Factor in the Claim Filing Technical Guide) corresponding to the effective debenture interest rate;
•	multiply the Daily Interest Rate Factor by the amount paid; then
•	multiply this result by the number of Days (see Appendix 8.b Julian Calendar in the Claim Filing Technical Guide) from the date paid (or Default date, if later) for each line Item to the earlier of:
o	the date in Item 104 (submission date for Part B); or
o	the date of the earliest time requirement missed (Items 204 and 304).
(3)	Interest for Expenditures Before the Date of Default
(a)	Standard
If the Mortgagee makes an expenditure or advance before the date of Default, the Mortgagee may only calculate debenture interest from the date of Default.

•	date of institution of foreclosure proceedings;
•	date of acquisition of title and possession by DIL of Foreclosure;
•	date the Property was acquired by the Commissioner under a direct conveyance from the Borrower; or
•	90 Days after the date of the Default of the SFB-Unemployment Agreement or Special Forbearance Agreement; or such other date as HUD may approve in writing prior to expiration of this 90-Day period.
(b)	Calculating Mortgage Note Interest using Daily Interest Rate Factors
To obtain the amount of accrued mortgage interest due, the Mortgagee must:
•	multiply the Daily Interest Rate Factor (see Appendix 8.c Daily Interest Rate Factor in the Claim Filing Technical Guide) by the amount of the unpaid principal balance; and
•	multiply the result by the number of days from the due date of the last completely paid installment to the date selected above as the “ending date.”
(c)	Time frame for Debenture Interest
When the Mortgagee files a claim for insurance benefits after a Default under an SFB-Unemployment Agreement or SFB Agreement, HUD will pay debenture interest for the period beginning on:
•	the date of initiation of foreclosure proceedings; or
•	the date of acquisition of title by the Mortgagee or by HUD.
This debenture interest period ends on the date of the initial claim payment or the date of interest curtailment.
(d)	Calculating Debenture Interest
HUD will compute the debenture interest at the time of payment of Part B, using the rate in effect at the time of the mortgage Default. Where “Mortgage Note Interest” is claimed on Part B because of an SFB-Unemployment Agreement or SFB Agreement, HUD will subtract from the claim any debenture interest already paid for the same period.
(2)	Interest on Claim Form
The Mortgagee must reflect the use of an SFB-Unemployment Agreement or SFB Agreement by entering the following in Item 121:
•	From: Enter the date of the last completely paid installment after all funds received under the Agreement are applied according to the terms of the Mortgage (Item 8, part A).
