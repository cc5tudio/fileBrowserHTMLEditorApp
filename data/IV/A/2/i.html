i.	Claim Type 33 ** - FHA-HAMP Partial Claim
The Mortgagee may file a claim for an FHA-HAMP Partial Claim incentive and insurance benefits under Claim Type 33 **. The Mortgagee may include in its claim legal fees and foreclosure costs for partial claims as outlined in the Servicing and Loss Mitigation section of the SF Handbook. HUD will pay the Mortgagee a financial incentive for the use of an FHA-HAMP Partial Claim in compliance with all regulatory requirements and procedures relating to the submission of incentive claims in FHAC.
The Mortgagee may only file for an incentive fee for the Loss Mitigation Option used to cure the Default. When the FHA-HAMP Partial Claim and FHA-HAMP Loan Modification are used together, the Mortgagee must submit two separate claims for the incentives for these two options.
HUD must receive a correct and complete claim submission of Parts A and B via FHAC within 60 Days of the execution date of the promissory Note and Mortgage or the incentive will be disallowed.
