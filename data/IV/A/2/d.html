d.	Claim Type 06 - Claims Without Conveyance of Title
The Mortgagee may file a CWCOT under Claim Type 06.
i.	CWCOT Processing Fee Exemption for Small Servicers
(A)	Standard
For Paper Claims only, HUD will reimburse the manual claim processing fee for Mortgagees who:
•	meet the definition of a small servicer under 12 CFR § 1026.41(e)(4)(ii);
•	do not have EDI capability; and
•	elect to bid the Commissioner’s Adjusted Fair Market Value (CAFMV) at the foreclosure sale under CWCOT guidelines.
(B)	Required Documentation
The Mortgagee meeting the small servicer exemption standards above must add the manual processing fee of $200 in Item 305 of Part D of form HUD-27011.
The Mortgagee must maintain documentation verifying that it meets the definition of a small servicer.
ii.	Computation of Interest
(A)	Debenture Interest
Provided that the Mortgagee has met all time requirements, HUD will pay debenture interest on the unpaid principal balance from the date of Default to either:
•	the date the Mortgagee or third-party bidder obtains title; or
•	the date the Borrower redeems the Property.
HUD will then pay debenture interest on the difference between the unpaid principal balance and the greater of either the CAFMV, redemption amount, or the third-party bid, to the date of final payment of the claim.
(B)	Calculating Interest for an Expenditure using Daily Interest Rate Factors
HUD will pay debenture interest on expenses from the date of expenditure to the date of final payment of the claim, as calculated using the method in Calculating Interest for an Expenditure using Daily Interest Rate Factors.
(C)	Calculating Interest for Default after SFB-Unemployment or SFB
When the Mortgagee files a claim for insurance benefits after a Default under an SFB-Unemployment Agreement or SFB, HUD will pay mortgage note interest as calculated under the procedures in Calculating Interest for Default after SFB-Unemployment or Special Forbearance.
(D)	Curtailment of Interest
The Mortgagee must self-curtail interest on Single Family claims for the following failures to meet HUD requirements as of the date on which the required action should have been taken:
•	failure to timely initiate foreclosure;
•	failure to give HUD notice of foreclosure;
•	failure to meet Reasonable Diligence Timeframes; and
•	failure to file the claim within 30 Days of:
o	the date the Mortgagee acquired good marketable title;
o	the date a third party acquired good marketable title;
o	the date the Borrower or other party redeemed the Property;
o	the date the redemption period expires; or
o	such other date as required by the FHA Commissioner.
If more than one time requirement is missed and there are no applicable extensions, the Mortgagee must calculate the interest for the claim payment to the earliest missed time requirement.
iii.	Computation of Claim Amount
(A)	Standard
The Mortgagee may claim 100 percent of the unpaid principal balance, plus allowable costs and debenture interest. HUD will deduct from the claim amount the sale bid or redemption price.
(B)	Eviction and P&P Costs when Property is Sold to a Third Party
When a third party is the successful bidder at the foreclosure sale, the Mortgagee may not claim reimbursement for costs relating to eviction or Property P&P after the sale. The Mortgagee may request reimbursement for those costs incurred, or for work completed, before the foreclosure sale but not paid until after the sale.
(C)	Hazard Insurance Premiums
HUD will not reimburse the Mortgagee for any hazard insurance premiums allocated to the period after acquisition of title by the Mortgagee or a third party.
(D)	Deficiency Judgments
When HUD required the deficiency judgment action or when HUD has approved the Mortgagee’s request to pursue the Judgment in relation to a CWCOT, the Mortgagee may request full reimbursement of certain fees.
(E)	Third-party Auction Service Fees
For successful third-party sales only, HUD will reimburse Mortgagees for independent third-party auction service fees they incur for an amount that does not exceed 5 percent of a Property’s net sales price.
iv.	Submission of Claim Form Parts to HUD for CWCOT
The Mortgagee must submit Parts A and B simultaneously no later than 30 Days after:
•	the date the Mortgagee acquired good marketable title;
•	the date a third party acquired good marketable title;
•	the date the Borrower or other party redeemed the Property;
•	the date the redemption period expires; or
•	such other date as required by the FHA Commissioner.
If filing via EDI or FHAC, the Mortgagee must submit Parts A and B no later than two Days after the date the form was prepared.
In all cases, the Mortgagee must also upload into P260:
•	all Parts of form HUD-27011;
•	the Closing Disclosure or similar legal document for post-foreclosure sales;
•	the appraisal;
•	appraisal invoices;
•	a worksheet reflecting the Mortgagee’s application of the CAFMV based on the adjustment provided in the instructions on FHAC; and
•	a third-party service fee invoice for auction services; if applicable.
