c.	Claim Type 05 - Supplemental Claims/Remittances
The Mortgagee may submit a supplemental claim under Claim Type 05.
i.	Definition
A Supplemental Claim is a claim readjusting the initial claim payment due to delayed disbursements or claim calculation or payment errors.
ii.	Standard
The Mortgagee may submit one supplemental claim within six months of final settlement for conveyance claims or full settlement for all other claim types in the following circumstances:
•	when a vendor delays submitting an invoice to the Mortgagee for an allowable expense;
•	for amounts paid after the date the original claim was filed if the obligations were incurred before the deed or assignment to HUD was filed for record or was paid on HUD’s written instruction;
•	requests for reconsideration of disallowed costs; or
•	additional attorney fees not paid on the original claim.
The Mortgagee may submit subsequent supplemental claims in the following circumstances:
•	overpayments due to HUD;
•	hazard insurance refund adjustments;
•	deficiency Judgments;
•	additional unpaid principal balance, with debenture interest, not paid on the original claim; or
•	where the Mortgagee has received approval from the National Servicing Center (NSC) to file a subsequent supplemental.
The Mortgagee may not submit supplemental claims prior to receipt of the original Part B payment except when Part A was overpaid.
iii.	Overpayments and Funds due HUD
(A)	Definition
An Overpayment is HUD’s payment of a claim in an inaccurate amount that results in money owed by the Mortgagee to HUD.
(B)	Claim Involves Overpayment
If the claim involves an overpayment, the Mortgagee must:
•	remit amounts due; and
•	retain in the Claim Review File a supplemental claim Part A explaining how the overpayment occurred in the “Mortgagee’s comments” section.
(C)	Claim Involves a Computation of Interest
If the amount overpaid or received involved a computation of interest, the Mortgagee must:
•	remit amounts due to HUD, including in the reimbursement:
o	interest calculated by the Mortgagee and included in Part B; and
o	interest calculated by HUD for the period from the date of claim to the date of payment; and
•	retain in the Claim Review File a supplemental claim Part A explaining how the overpayment occurred in the “Mortgagee’s comments” section.
(D)	Remittance of Amounts Due
The Mortgagee must remit amounts due via pay.gov using the Claim Remittance functions in FHAC.
iv.	Hazard Insurance Refund Adjustment
(A)	Standard
The Mortgagee may submit a supplemental claim for a hazard insurance refund adjustment when it has met all of the following conditions:
•	hazard insurance costs were included in the initial submission of form HUD-27011, Part B; and
•	the Mortgagee has documented in its Claim Review File its efforts in diligently following up with the hazard insurance carrier to confirm any necessary adjustment.
When the Mortgagee becomes aware of a hazard insurance refund within six months of final settlement, the Mortgagee must file its supplemental claim within six months of the final settlement; otherwise, the Mortgagee may submit its supplemental claim within one year from the date of final settlement.
(B)	Claim Form Preparation
When completing and submitting the supplemental claim, the Mortgagee must:
•	include a copy of the carrier’s notification with its submission; and
•	clearly indicate in the “Mortgagee’s comments” section that the supplemental claim is being filed to recover an adjustment to the hazard insurance premium refund.
v.	Deficiency Judgments
The Mortgagee may submit one supplemental claim for the additional costs related to the pursuit of the deficiency Judgment when all such known costs were included in the initial submission of Part B of form HUD-27011, or, to the extent possible, are claimed within six months from the date of final settlement of the initial Part B.
vi.	Attorney Fees
The Mortgagee may submit a supplemental claim for attorney fees if it believes that it is entitled to an amount more than was actually reimbursed in the initial claim payment. The supplemental claim must include:
•	a supplemental claim form HUD-27011, with an explanation of the need for the increased fee in “Mortgagee’s comments;”
•	a copy of all Parts submitted in the original claim filing;
•	a copy of the final Advice of Payment letter; and
•	copies of the attorney chronology and any documentation necessary to support the additional claimed amount.
The Mortgagee must retain in the Claim Review File adequate documentation supporting all attorney fees. Should HUD determine in a post-claim review that the claim for attorney fees is greater than allowed amounts or is unsupported by documentation, HUD will bill the Mortgagee for overpayment as:
•	an amount statistically calculated for all claims within the review period; or
•	the actual amount of the overpayment, if the review was not based on a statistical sample.
vii.	Claims for Additional Funds
The Mortgagee may submit one supplemental claim for additional funds within six months of the date of final settlement for conveyance claims or full settlement for all other claim types. The Mortgagee may only file a supplemental claim before receipt of the original Part B payment when Part A was overpaid.
(A)	Supplemental Claims for Correction of Dates in Part A
When the claim for additional funds is based on a corrected date on the Part A claim, the Mortgagee must include:

(B)	Claims for Additional Funds when Subject to Administrative Offsets
The Mortgagee must not claim additional funds when HUD is offsetting amounts.
(C)	Claims for Funds Related to Partial Claims
