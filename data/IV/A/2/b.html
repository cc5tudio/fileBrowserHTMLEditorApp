iii.	Single Family Loan Sales Claims
The SFLS Program is a program through which participating Mortgagees may file assignment claims for insurance benefits.
SFLS claims are only authorized in connection with the execution of a PSA between HUD and the Mortgagee for an identified Distressed Asset Stabilization Program (DASP) sale, which is the sale through which HUD will dispose of the asset after payment of the claim. The SFLS claim is governed by the specific terms of the PSA for the specific DASP sale identified in the PSA.
(A)	Claim Submission Process
The Mortgagee must follow the initial claim submission and claim submission report procedures set forth in the PSA. Upon the Mortgagee’s compliance with these procedures, HUD will enter an SFLS Claim Identification Date in the claims processing system.
On the business day after the award of the pools of Mortgages, HUD will enter a list of awarded Mortgages (Award Report) in the claims processing system.
For Mortgages with an SFLS Claim Identification Date and that are included in the Award Report, the Mortgagee may submit assignment claims until the Claims Cut-off Date noted on Schedule I of the PSA. The Mortgagee may only submit assignment claims for eligible mortgages as defined in the PSA.
For Mortgages that are not awarded in the sale, the Mortgagee may submit insurance claims under CWCOT procedures and as further described in the PSA.
