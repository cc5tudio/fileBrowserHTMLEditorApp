h.	Claim Type 32 ** - FHA-HAMP Loan Modification
The Mortgagee may file a claim for an FHA-HAMP Loan Modification incentive under Claim Type 32 **. HUD will pay the Mortgagee a financial incentive for the use of an FHA-HAMP Loan Modification in compliance with all regulatory requirements and procedures relating to the submission of incentive claims in FHAC.
The Mortgagee may only file for an incentive fee for the Loss Mitigation Option used to cure the Default. When the FHA-HAMP Partial Claim and FHA-HAMP Loan Modification are used together, the Mortgagee must submit two separate claims for the incentives for these two options.
HUD must receive a correct and complete claim submission of Parts A and B via FHAC within 60 Days of the execution date of the FHA-HAMP Loan Modification or the incentive claim will not be processed.
