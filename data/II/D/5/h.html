<!-- Flood Zone -->

<p>The Appraiser must stop work and contact the Mortgagee if the Appraiser determines that a Manufactured Home is located in FEMA Flood Zones A or V. The Appraiser may continue to work on the assignment if the Mortgagee provides a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) or Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) or flood elevation certification. If the Appraiser is provided with a LOMA or LOMR that removes the Property from the flood zone, the Appraiser does not need to indicate that the Property is in a flood zone. If provided with an elevation certificate, the Appraiser must indicate the Property is in a flood hazard area on the appraisal report.</p>
