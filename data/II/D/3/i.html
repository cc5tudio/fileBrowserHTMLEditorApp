<!-- Structural Conditions -->

<p>The Appraiser must report on structural conditions so that the Mortgagee can determine if the foundation and Structure of the Property will be serviceable for the life of the Mortgage.</p>

<p>The Appraiser must perform a visual observation of the foundation and Structure of the improvements and report those results. If the Appraiser notes any structural issues, the Appraiser must address the nature of the deficiency in the appraisal where physical deficiencies or adverse conditions are reported and require inspection.</p>
