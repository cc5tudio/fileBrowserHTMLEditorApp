<h3>vi. Excess and Surplus Land</h3>
<h4>(A)  Definition</h4>
<p>Excess Land refers to land that is not needed to serve or support the existing improvement. The highest and best use of the Excess Land may or may not be the same as the highest and best use of the improved parcel. Excess Land may have the potential to be sold separately.</p>
<p>Surplus Land refers to land that is not currently needed to support the existing improvement but cannot be separated from the Property and sold off. Surplus Land does not have an independent highest and best use and may or may not contribute to the value of the improved parcels.</p>
<h4>(B)  Required Analysis and Reporting</h4>
<p>The Appraiser must include the highest and best use analysis in the appraisal report to support the Appraiser’s conclusion of the existence of Excess Land. The Appraiser must include Surplus Land in the valuation.</p>
<p>If the subject of an appraisal contains two or more legally conforming platted lots under one legal description and ownership, and the second vacant lot is capable of being divided and/or developed as a separate parcel where such a division will not result in a non-conformity in zoning regulations for the remaining improved lot, the second vacant lot is Excess Land.

<h5>(2)  Required Analysis and Reporting</h5>
<p>The Appraiser must provide a comment that the non-standard house style appears structurally sound and readily marketable and must apply appropriate techniques for analysis and evaluation. In order for such a Property to be fully marketable, the Appraiser must demonstrate that it is located in an area of other similar types of construction and blend in with the landscape.</p>
<p>The Appraiser may require additional education, experience, or assistance for these types of Properties.</p>
<h4>(D)  Modular Housing</h4>
<h5>(1)  Definition</h5>
<p>Modular Housing refers to Structures constructed according to state and local codes off-site in a factory, transported to a building lot, and assembled by a contractor into a finished house.

<h5>(2)  Required Analysis and Reporting</h5>
<p>The Appraiser must treat Modular Housing the same as stick-built housing, including reporting the appraisal on the same form. The Appraiser must select and analyze appropriate comparable sales, which may include conventionally built housing, Modular Housing or Manufactured Housing.</p>
<h4>(E)  Identifying an Accessory Dwelling Unit</h4>
<h5>(1)  Definition</h5>
<p>An Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) refers to a habitable living unit added to, created within, or detached from a primary one-unit Single Family dwelling, which together constitute a single interest in real estate. It is a separate additional living unit, including kitchen, sleeping, and bathroom facilities.</p>
<h5>(2)  Required Analysis and Reporting</h5>
<p>As part of the highest and best use analysis, the Appraiser must make the determination to classify the Property as a Single Family dwelling with an ADU, or a two-family dwelling. The conclusion of the highest and best use analysis will then determine the classification of the Property and the analysis and reporting required.</p>
<p>An ADU is usually subordinate in size, location and appearance to the primary Dwelling Unit and may or may not have separately metered utilities or separate means of ingress or egress. The Appraiser must not include the living area of the ADU in the calculation of the Gross Living Area (GLA) of the primary dwelling.</p>
<p>The Appraiser must notify the Mortgagee of the deficiency in MPR or MPS if more than one ADU is located on the subject Property.</p>
<h4>(F)  Additional Manufactured Home on Property</h4>
<p>The Appraiser may consider a Manufactured Home to be an ADU if it meets the highest and best use and FHA requirements.</p>
<p>The Appraiser may value a Manufactured Home on the Property that physically or legally may not be used as a dwelling and does not pose any health and safety issues by its continued presence as a storage unit.</p>
<h4>(G)  Leased Equipment, Components, and Mechanical Systems</h4>
<p>The Appraiser must not include the value of leased mechanical systems and components in the Market Value of the subject Property. This includes furnaces, water heaters, fuel or propane storage tanks, solar or wind systems (including power purchase agreements), and other mechanical systems and components that are not owned by the property owner.
