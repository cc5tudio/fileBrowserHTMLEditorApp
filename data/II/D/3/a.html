<!-- Additional Documentation Required for Appraisals of New Construction -->

<p>When New Construction is less than 90% complete at the time of the appraisal, the Appraiser must document the floor plan, plot plan, and exhibits necessary to determine the size and level of finish.</p>

<p>When New Construction is 90% or more complete, the Appraiser must document a list of components to be installed or completed after the date of appraisal.</p>

<h4>Appraiser Responsibility to Report Property Compliance</h4>

<p>The Appraiser must observe, analyze and report that the Property meets HUD’s MPR and MPS.</p>

<p>Minimum Property Requirements (MPR) refer to general requirements that all homes insured by FHA be safe, sound, and secure.</p>

<p>Minimum Property Standards (MPS) refer to regulatory requirements relating to the safety, soundness and security of New Construction.</p>

<p>Every Property must be safe, sound, and secure so that the Mortgagee can determine eligibility. The Appraiser must note every instance where the Property is not safe, sound, and secure and does not comply with FHA’s MPR and MPS.</p>
