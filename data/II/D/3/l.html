<!-- Foundation -->

<p>The Appraiser must examine the foundation for readily observable evidence of safety or structural deficiencies that may require repair. If a deficiency is noted, the Appraiser must describe the nature of the deficiency and report necessary repairs, alterations or required inspections in the appraisal where physical deficiencies or adverse conditions are reported.</p>

<p>For Manufactured Housing, the appraisal must be conditioned upon the certification of an engineer or architect that the foundation is in compliance with the Permanent Foundations Guide for Manufactured Housing (PFGMH).</p>

<h3>i. Basement</h3>
<p>The Appraiser must notify the Mortgagee of the deficiency of MPR or MPS if the basement is not free of dampness, wetness, or obvious structural problems that might affect the health and safety of occupants or the soundness of the Structure.</p>

<h3>ii. Sump Pumps</h3>
<p>The Appraiser must notify the Mortgagee of the deficiency of MPR or MPS if the sump pump is not properly functioning at the time of appraisal. A sump pump may be hard-wired by an acceptable wiring method or may have a factory electrical cord that is to be connected to a receptacle suitable for such use.</p>
