<!-- Utility Services -->

<h3>i. Definition</h3>
<p>Utility Services refer to those services consumed by the public such as individual electric, water, natural gas, sewage, and telephone.</p>

<h3>ii. Required Analysis and Reporting</h3>
<p>The Appraiser must notify the Mortgagee of the deficiency of MPR or MPS if the subject Property is an attached, detached, or manufactured Single Family dwelling and the utilities are not independent for each living unit. This does not apply to ADUs.</p>

<p>The Appraiser must also notify the Mortgagee of the deficiency of MPR or MPS if utilities are not located on Easements that have been permanently dedicated to the local government or appropriate public utility body.</p>

<h4>(A)  Multiple Living Units Under Single Ownership</h4>
<p>The Appraiser should not note a deficiency of MPR or MPS if the Property contains multiple living units under a single Mortgage or ownership (two- to four-family Properties) that utilize common services, such as water, sewer, gas and electricity and is served by one meter in jurisdictions that allow single meter rental properties, unless separate utility service shut-offs are not provided for each.</p>
<p>The Appraiser must notify the Mortgagee of the deficiency of MPR or MPS if other facilities are not independent for each living unit, except common services such as laundry, storage space or heating, which may be provided in two- to four-living unit buildings under a single Mortgage.</p>
<h4>(B)  Living Units Under Separate Ownership</h4>
<p>The Appraiser should not note the deficiency of MPR or MPS if the Property contains living units under separate ownership and part of a larger planned community, that utilize common utility services provided from the main to the building line when protected by an Easement or covenant and maintenance agreement, unless individual utilities serving a living unit pass over, under, or through another living unit without provision for repair and maintenance of utilities without trespass on adjoining properties, or legal provision for permanent right of access for maintenance and repair of utilities.</p>
<p>If a single drain line in the building serves more than one unit, and the building drain clean-outs are not accessible from the exterior, the Appraiser must note the deficiency of MPR or MPS to the Mortgagee.</p>
<h3>iii. Individual Water Supply Systems</h3>
<h4>(A)  Definition</h4>
<p>An Individual Water Supply System refers to a potable water source providing water to an individual Property.</p>
<h4>(B)  Standard</h4>
<p>When an Individual Water Supply System is present, water quality must meet the requirements of the health authority with jurisdiction. If there are no local (or state) water quality standards, then water must be potable, which may be demonstrated by compliance with the current EPA Manual of Individual and Non-Public Water Supply Systems.</p>
<p>Soil poisoning is an unacceptable method for treating termites unless satisfactory assurance is provided that the treatment will not endanger the quality of the water supply.</p>
<h4>(C)  Required Analysis and Reporting</h4>
<p>When the Appraiser obtains evidence that any of the water quality requirements are not met, the Appraiser must notify the Mortgagee and provide a cost to cure.</p>
<h5>(1)  Conditions for Individual Water Supplies</h5>
<p>The Appraiser must note the deficiency of MPR or MPS if the subject Property contains a well located within the foundation walls of an existing dwelling and there is no evidence that the local jurisdiction recognizes and permits such a location, that it is common for the market area, and does not adversely affect marketability unless the well is located within the foundation walls of a New Construction dwelling in an arctic or sub-arctic region.</p>
<p>The Appraiser must report when water to a Property is supplied by dug wells, cisterns or holding tanks used in conjunction with water purchased and hauled to the site. The Appraiser must report whether such systems are readily accepted by local market participants and that the water supply system may violate MPR or MPS.</p>
<p>The Appraiser must note the deficiency of MPR or MPS if the subject Property has a water source that includes a mechanical chlorinator or is served by springs, lakes, rivers, sand-point or artesian wells.</p>
<p>A pressure tank with a minimum capacity of 42 gallons must be provided. However, pre-pressured tanks and other pressurizing devices are acceptable if delivery between pump cycles equal or exceed that of a 42-gallon tank. Tanks must be equipped with a clean-out plug at the lowest point and a suitable pressure relief valve.</p>
<h5>(2)  Required Analysis and Reporting</h5>
<p>The Appraiser must note any readily observable deficiencies regarding the well and require test or inspection if any of the following apply:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the water supply relies upon a water purification system due to the presence of contaminates;</li>
    <li>corrosion of pipes (plumbing);</li>
    <li>areas of intensive agricultural uses within one quarter mile;</li>
    <li>coal mining or gas drilling operations within one quarter mile;</li>
    <li>a dump, junkyard, landfill, factory, gas station, or dry cleaning operation within one quarter mile; or</li>
    <li>an unusually objectionable taste, smell, or appearance of well water.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Appraiser must also be familiar with the minimum distance requirements between private wells and sources of pollution and, if discernible, comment on them. The Appraiser is not required to sketch or note distances between the well, property lines, septic tanks, drain fields, or building Structures but may provide estimated distances where they are comfortable doing so. When available, the Appraiser should obtain from the homeowner or Mortgagee a copy of a survey or other documents attesting to the separation distances between the well and septic system or other sources of pollution.</p>

<h3>iv. Shared Wells</h3>
<h4>(A)  Definition</h4>
<p>A Shared Well refers to a well that services two to four homes where there is a binding Shared Well Agreement between the property owners that meets FHA requirements.</p>
<h4>(B)  Required Analysis and Reporting</h4>
<p>If the Property has a Shared Well, the Appraiser must report it and note any readily observable deficiencies. The Appraiser must also obtain a Shared Well Agreement and include it in the appraisal report so that the Mortgagee may review the agreement to determine eligibility. The Appraiser must also require an inspection under the same circumstances as an individual well.</p>
<h3>v. Community Water Systems</h3>
<h4>(A)  Definition</h4>
<p>A Community Water System refers to a central system that is owned, operated and maintained by a private corporation or a nonprofit property ownersâ€™ association.</p>
