    <!-- Required Analysis and Reporting -->

    <p>The Appraiser must obtain a copy of the lease from the Mortgagee. The Appraiser must analyze and report the terms of the ground lease, including the amount of the Ground Rent, the term of the lease, if the lease is renewable, if the lessee has the right of redemption (the right to obtain a Fee Simple title by paying the value of the Leased Fee to the lessor, thereby cancelling the Ground Rent), and if the Ground Rent can increase or decrease over the life of the lease term.</p>

    <p>The Appraiser must estimate and report the value of the Leasehold Interest using the calculation in the box below. The Appraiser must provide support for the capitalization rate selected.</p>

    <table border="1">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <td>Calculation of the Leasehold Interest</td>
            </tr>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Value of Leased Fee = Ground Rent / Capitalization Rate</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Value of Leasehold = Value of Fee Simple - Value of Leased Fee</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>

    <p>In valuing the Leasehold Interest, the Appraiser must apply the appropriate techniques to each of the approaches to value included in the analysis.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>In the cost approach, the value of the land reported must be its Leasehold Interest.</li>
        <li>In the GRM income approach, the sales used to derive the GRM factor must be based on properties under similar Ground Rent terms (or be adjusted to similar Ground Rent terms).</li>
        <li>In the sales comparison analysis, the comparable sales must be adjusted for their lack of similarity to the subject in the &ldquo;Ownership Rights&rdquo; section of the sales adjustment grid.</li>
    </ul>
