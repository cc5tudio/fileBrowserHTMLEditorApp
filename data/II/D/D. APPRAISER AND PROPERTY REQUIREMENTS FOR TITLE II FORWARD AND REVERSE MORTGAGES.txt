D.	APPRAISER AND PROPERTY REQUIREMENTS FOR TITLE II FORWARD AND REVERSE MORTGAGES
The appraisal process provides the Mortgagee with necessary information to determine if a property meets the minimum requirements and eligibility standards for a Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured Mortgage and will serve as adequate security for a specific FHA-insured Mortgage. Mortgagees bear primary responsibility for determining eligibility and the sufficiency of collateral; however, the Appraiser provides preliminary verification that the Property Acceptability Criteria have been met and an appraised value for the property.
Property refers to the real estate entity that will serve as adequate security for a specific FHA-insured Mortgage.
The requirements in this section of the FHA Single Family Housing Policy Handbook (SF Handbook) contain the Property Acceptability Criteria for FHA mortgage insurance, which include Minimum Property Requirements (MPR) and Minimum Property Standards (MPS), and include by reference, associated rules and regulations. The criteria apply to residential Properties containing one- to four-family housing units, individual condominium units, and Manufactured Housing units, and related property improvements and the sites on which they are located, as well as the immediate environment for the dwelling, including streets and other services or facilities associated with the site. Manufactured Housing Properties have additional requirements contained in the Property Acceptability Criteria for Manufactured Housing for Title II Insured Mortgages section. This section also provides requirements for Appraisers in establishing a credible appraised value for a Property that is to serve as security for an FHA-insured Mortgage.
