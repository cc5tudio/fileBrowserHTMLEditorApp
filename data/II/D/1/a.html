<!-- Information Required before Commencement of Appraisal -->

<p>The effective date of the appraisal cannot be before the FHA case number assignment date unless the Mortgagee certifies that the appraisal was ordered for conventional lending or government-guaranteed loan purposes and was performed pursuant to FHA guidelines.</p>

<p>The appraisal must be in full compliance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP), which requires that this be classified as a new assignment. The intended use of the appraisal must indicate that it is solely to assist FHA in assessing the risk of the Property securing the FHA-insured Mortgage. Additionally, FHA and the Mortgagee must be indicated as the intended users of the appraisal report.</p>

<p>If the Appraiser determines that the scope of work is met with regard to MPR, MPS, and USPAP compliance, and further determines that a re-inspection of the Property is not necessary, the effective date of the appraisal may be the date of the original inspection. However, if an FHA-compliant inspection is required, the date of the inspection will become the effective date of the new appraisal.</p>

<p>The Appraiser must obtain all of the following from the Mortgagee before beginning an appraisal:
<ul>
    <li>a complete copy of the executed sales contract for the subject, if a purchase transaction;</li>
    <li>the land lease, if applicable;</li>
    <li>surveys or legal descriptions, if available;</li>
    <li>any other legal documents contained in the loan file; and</li>
    <li>a point of contact and contact information for the Mortgagee so that the Appraiser can communicate any noncompliance issues.</li>
</ul>
