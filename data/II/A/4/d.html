<h3>i.      General Asset Requirements (TOTAL)</h3>

<p>The Mortgagee may only consider assets derived from acceptable sources in accordance with the requirements outlined below.</p>

<p>Closing costs, prepaid items and other fees may not be applied towards the Borrower’s MRI.</p>

<h4>(A) Earnest Money Deposit (TOTAL)</h4>

<p>The Mortgagee must verify and document the deposit amount and source of funds if the amount of the earnest money deposit exceeds 1 percent of the sales price or is excessive based on the Borrower’s history of accumulating savings, by obtaining:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a copy of the Borrower’s canceled check;</li>
  <li>certification from the deposit-holder acknowledging receipt of funds; or</li>
  <li>a Verification of Deposit (VOD) or bank statement showing that the average balance was sufficient to cover the amount of the earnest money deposit at the time of the deposit.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the source of the earnest money deposit was a gift, the Mortgagee must verify that the gift is in compliance with Gifts (Personal and Equity) (TOTAL).</p>

<h4>(B) Cash to Close (TOTAL)</h4>

<p>The Mortgagee must document all funds that are used for the purpose of qualifying for or closing a Mortgage, including those to satisfy debt or pay costs outside of closing.</p>

<p>The Mortgagee must verify and document that the Borrower has sufficient funds from an acceptable source to facilitate the closing.</p>

<h5>(1)  Determining the Amount Needed for Closing</h5>

<p>For a purchase transaction, the amount of cash needed by the Borrower to close an FHA-insured Mortgage is the difference between the total cost to acquire the Property and the total mortgage amount.</p>

<p>For a refinance transaction, the amount of cash needed by the Borrower to close an FHA-insured Mortgage is the difference between the total payoff requirements of the Mortgage being refinanced and the total mortgage amount.</p>

<h5>(2)  Mortgagee Responsibility for Estimating Settlement Requirements</h5>

<p>In addition to the MRI, additional Borrower expenses must be included in the total amount of cash that the Borrower must provide at mortgage settlement.</p>

<h6>(a)  Origination Fees and Other Closing Costs</h6>

<p>The Mortgagee or sponsored TPO may charge a reasonable origination fee.</p>

<p>The Mortgagee or sponsored TPO may charge and collect from Borrowers those customary and reasonable closing costs necessary to close the Mortgage. Charges may not exceed the actual costs.</p>

<p>The Mortgagee must comply with HUD’s Qualified Mortgage Rule at 24 CFR § 203.19.</p>

<h6>(b)  Discount Points</h6>

<p>Discount Points refer to a charge from the Mortgagee for the interest rate chosen. They are paid by the Borrower and become part of the total cash required to close.</p>

<h6>(c)   Types of Prepaid Items (Including Per Diem Interest)</h6>

<p>Prepaid items may include flood and hazard insurance premiums, MIPs, real estate taxes, and per diem interest. They must comply with the requirements of the CFPB.</p>

<h6>(d)  Non-Realty or Personal Property</h6>

<p>Non-Realty or Personal Property items (chattel) that the Borrower agrees to pay for separately, including the amount subtracted from the sales price when determining the maximum Mortgage, are included in the total cash requirements for the Mortgage.</p>

<h6>(e)   Upfront Mortgage Insurance Premium Amounts</h6>

<p>Any UFMIP amounts paid in cash are added to the total cash settlement requirements. The UFMIP must be entirely financed into the Mortgage or paid entirely in cash. However, if the UFMIP is financed into the Mortgage, the entire amount is to be financed except for any amount less than $1.00.</p>

<h6>(f)   Real Estate Agent Fees</h6>

<p>If a Borrower is represented by a real estate agent and must pay any fee directly to the agent, that expense must be included in the total of the Borrower’s settlement requirements.</p>

<h6>(g)  Repairs and Improvements</h6>

<p>Repairs and improvements, or any portion paid by the Borrower that cannot be financed into the Mortgage, are part of the Borrower’s total cash requirements.</p>

<h6>(h)  Premium Pricing on FHA-Insured Mortgages</h6>

<p>Premium Pricing refers to a credit from a Mortgagee for the interest rate chosen.</p>

<p>Premium Pricing may be used to pay a Borrower’s actual closing costs and/or prepaid items. Closing costs paid in this manner do not need to be included as part of the Interested Party limitation.</p>

<p>The funds derived from a premium priced Mortgage:</p>
<ul>
  <li>must be disclosed in accordance with RESPA;</li>
  <li>must be used to reduce the principal balance if the credit amount exceeds the actual dollar amount for closing costs and prepaid expenses; and</li>
  <li>may not be used for payment of debts, collection accounts, escrow shortages or missed Mortgage Payments, or Judgments.</li>
</ul>

<h6>(i)    Interested Party Contributions on the Closing Disclosure</h6>

<p>The Mortgagee may apply Interested Party credits to the closing costs and prepaid items including any items Paid Outside Closing (POC).</p>

<p>The refund of the Borrower’s POCs may be used toward the Borrower’s MRI if the Mortgagee documents that the POCs were paid with the Borrower’s own funds.</p>

<p>The Mortgagee must identify the total Interested Party credits on the front page of the Closing Disclosure or similar legal document or in an addendum. The Mortgagee must identify each item paid by Interested Party Contributions.</p>

<h6>(j)   Real Estate Tax Credits</h6>

<p>Where real estate taxes are paid in arrears, the seller’s real estate tax credit may be used to meet the MRI, if the Mortgagee documents that the Borrower had sufficient assets to meet the MRI and the Borrower paid closing costs at the time of underwriting.</p>

<p>This permits the Borrower to bring a portion of their MRI to the closing and combine that portion with the real estate tax credit for their total MRI.</p>

<h4>(C) Reserves (TOTAL)</h4>

<p>The Mortgagee must verify and document all assets submitted to the AUS.</p>

<p>Reserves refer to the sum of the Borrower’s verified and documented liquid assets minus the total funds the Borrower is required to pay at closing.</p>

<p>Reserves do not include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the amount of cash taken at settlement in cash-out transactions;</li>
  <li>incidental cash received at settlement in other loan transactions;</li>

  <li>borrowed funds from any source.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Mortgagee must verify and document Reserves equivalent to three months’ PITI after closing for three- to four-unit Properties.</p>

<h3>ii.     Source Requirements for the Borrower’s Minimum Required Investment (TOTAL)</h3>

<h4>(A) Definition</h4>

<p>Minimum Required Investment (MRI) refers to the Borrower’s contribution in cash or its equivalent required by Section 203(b)(9) of the National Housing Act, which represents at least 3.5 percent of the Adjusted Value of the Property.</p>

<h4>(B) Standard</h4>

<p>The Mortgagee may only permit the Borrower’s MRI to be provided by a source permissible under Section 203(b)(9)(C) of the National Housing Act, which means the funds for the Borrower’s MRI must not come from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(1)  the seller of the Property;</li>
  <li>(2)  any other person or Entity who financially benefits from the transaction (directly or indirectly); or</li>
  <li>(3)  anyone who is or will be reimbursed, directly or indirectly, by any party included in (1) or (2) above.</li>
</ul>

<p>While additional funds to close may be provided by one of these sources if permitted under the relevant source of funds requirements above, none of the Borrower’s MRI may come from these sources. The Mortgagee must document permissible sources for the full MRI in accordance with special requirements noted above.</p>

<p>Additionally, in accordance with Prohibited Sources of Minimum Cash Investment Under the National Housing Act -Interpretive Rule, HUD does not interpret Section 203(b)(9)(C) of the National Housing Act to prohibit Governmental Entities, when acting in their governmental capacity, from providing the Borrower’s MRI where the Governmental Entity is originating the insured Mortgage through one of its homeownership programs.</p>

<h4>(C) Required Documentation</h4>

<p>Where the Borrower’s MRI is provided by someone other than the Borrower, the Mortgagee must also obtain documentation to support the permissible nature of the source of those funds.</p>

<p>To establish that the Governmental Entity provided the Borrower’s MRI in a manner consistent with HUD’s Interpretive Rule, the Mortgagee must document that the Governmental Entity incurred prior to or at closing an enforceable legal liability or obligation to fund the Borrower’s MRI. It is not sufficient to document that the Governmental Entity has agreed to reimburse the Mortgagee for the use of funds legally belonging to the Mortgagee to fund the Borrower’s MRI.</p>

<p>The Mortgagee must obtain:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a canceled check, evidence of wire transfer or other draw request showing that prior to or at the time of closing the Governmental Entity had authorized a draw of the funds provided towards the Borrower’s MRI from the Governmental Entity’s account; or</li>
  <li>a letter from the Governmental Entity, signed by an authorized official, establishing that the funds provided towards the Borrower’s MRI were funds legally belonging to the Governmental Entity, when acting in their governmental capacity, at or before closing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a letter from the Governmental Entity is submitted, the precise language of the letter may vary, but must demonstrate that the funds provided for the Borrower’s MRI legally belonged to the Governmental Entity at or before closing, by stating, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the Governmental Entity has, at or before closing, incurred a legally enforceable liability as a result of its agreement to provide the funds towards the Borrower’s MRI;</li>
  <li>the Governmental Entity has, at or before closing, incurred a legally enforceable obligation to provide the funds towards the Borrower’s MRI; or</li>
  <li>the Governmental Entity has, at or before closing, authorized a draw on its account to provide the funds towards the Borrower’s MRI.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the Mortgagee is not required to document the actual transfer of funds in satisfaction of the obligation or liability, the failure of the Governmental Entity to satisfy the obligation or liability may result in a determination that the funds were provided by a prohibited source.</p>

<h6>(a)  Definitions</h6>

<p>A Governmental Entity refers to any federal, state, or local government agency or instrumentality.</p>

<p>To be considered an Instrumentality of Government, the Entity must be established by a governmental body or with governmental approval or under special law to serve a particular public purpose or designated by law (statute or court opinion) and does not have 501(c)(3) status. HUD deems Section 115 Entities to be Instrumentalities of Government for the purpose of providing secondary financing.</p>

<p>Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere (HOPE) Grantee refers to an Entity designated in the homeownership plan submitted by an applicant for an implementation grant under the HOPE program.</p>

<p>Nonprofits assisting a Governmental Entity in the operation of its secondary financing programs must have HUD approval and placement on the Nonprofit Organization Roster unless there is a documented agreement that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the functions performed are limited to the Governmental Entity’s secondary financing program; and</li>
  <li>the secondary financing legal documents (Note and Deed of Trust) name the Governmental Entity as the Mortgagee.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Mortgagee must enter information on HUD-approved Nonprofits into FHA Connection (FHAC), as applicable.</p>

<p>Secondary financing provided by Governmental Entities or HOPE grantees may be used to meet the Borrower’s MRI. Any loan of the Borrower’s MRI must also comply with the additional requirements set forth in Source Requirements for the Borrower’s MRI.</p>

<p>There is no maximum Combined Loan-to-Value (CLTV) for secondary financing loans provided by Governmental Entities or HOPE grantees.</p>

<p>Any secondary financing meeting this standard is deemed to have prior approval in accordance with 24 CFR § 203.32.</p>

    <li>a statement indicating whether the secondary financing:
        <ul>
          <li>will close in the name of the Governmental Entity; or</li>
          <li>will be closed in the name of the nonprofit and held by the Governmental Entity.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>

</ul>

<p>Where a nonprofit assisting a Governmental Entity with its secondary financing programs is not a HUD-approved Nonprofit, a documented agreement must be provided that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the functions performed by the nonprofit are limited to the Governmental Entity’s secondary financing program; and</li>
  <li>the secondary financing legal documents (Note and Deed of Trust) name the Governmental Entity as the Mortgagee.</li>
</ul>

<h5>(2)  Secondary Financing Provided by HUD-Approved Nonprofits (TOTAL)</h5>
