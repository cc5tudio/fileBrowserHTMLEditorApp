<p>The Mortgagee may approve the Mortgage as eligible for FHA insurance endorsement if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>TOTAL Mortgage Scorecard rated the mortgage application as Accept;</li>
  <li>the underwriter underwrote the appraisal according to standard FHA requirements;</li>
  <li>the Mortgagee reviewed the TOTAL Mortgage Scorecard findings, and verified that all information entered into TOTAL Mortgage Scorecard is consistent with mortgage documentation, and is true, complete, and accurate; and</li>
  <li>the Mortgage meets all FHA requirements applicable to Mortgages receiving a rating of Accept from TOTAL Mortgage Scorecard.</li>
</ul>

<p>While TOTAL Mortgage Scorecard is available for Mortgagees to use in their pre-qualification process of mortgage applicants, the Mortgagee must score the Mortgage at least once after assignment of an FHA case number. FHA will not recognize the risk assessment nor will information be carried from TOTAL Mortgage Scorecard to FHAC for endorsement processing, without an FHA case number. It is imperative that the Mortgagees make certain that they enter the FHA case number into their Loan Origination System or AUS as soon as it is known. This will ensure a more efficient endorsement process.</p>
