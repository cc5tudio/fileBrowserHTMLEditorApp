<!-- Preparing the Work Write-Up and Cost Estimate -->

<p>The Consultant must prepare a Work Write-Up that identifies each Work Item. The Work Write-Up must be prepared in a categorical manner that addresses each of the 35 point checklist items. The Consultant must indicate which Work Items require permits.</p>

<p>The Consultant must also prepare a Cost Estimate for each Work Item in the Work Write-Up. The Cost Estimate must separately identify labor costs and itemize the cost of materials per Work Item.
