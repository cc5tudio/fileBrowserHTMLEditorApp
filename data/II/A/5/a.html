<h3>i.	General Credit Requirements (Manual)</h3>

<p>FHA&rsquo;s general credit policy requires Mortgagees to analyze the Borrower&rsquo;s credit history, liabilities, and debts to determine creditworthiness. </p>
<p>The Mortgagee must either obtain a Tri-Merged Credit Report (TRMCR) or a Residential Mortgage Credit Report (RMCR) from an independent consumer reporting agency.</p>
<p>The Mortgagee must utilize the same credit report and credit scores sent to TOTAL.</p>
<p>The Mortgagee must obtain a credit report for each Borrower who will be obligated on the mortgage Note. The Mortgagee may obtain a joint report for individuals with joint accounts. </p>
<p>The Mortgagee must obtain a credit report for a non-borrowing spouse who resides in a community property state, or if the subject Property is located in a community property state. The credit report must indicate the non-borrowing spouse&rsquo;s SSN, where an SSN exists, was matched with the SSA, or the Mortgagee must either provide separate documentation indicating that the SSN was matched with the SSA or provide a statement that the non-borrowing spouse does not have an SSN. Where an SSN does not exist for a non-borrowing spouse, the credit report must contain, at a minimum, the non-borrowing spouse&rsquo;s full name, date of birth, and previous addresses for the last two years.</p>
<p>The Mortgagee is not required to obtain a credit report for non-credit qualifying Streamline Refinance transactions.</p>
<h3>ii.	Types of Credit History (Manual)</h3>
<p>If a traditional credit report is available, the Mortgagee must use a traditional credit report. However, if a traditional credit report is not available, the Mortgagee must develop the Borrower&rsquo;s credit history using the requirements for Non-Traditional and Insufficient Credit.</p>
<h3>(A)	Traditional Credit (Manual)</h3>
<p>If the TRMCR or RMCR generates a credit score, the Mortgagee must utilize traditional credit history.</p>
<h3>(1)	Requirements for the Credit Report</h3>
<p>Credit reports must obtain all information from at least two credit repositories pertaining to credit, residence history, and public records information; be in an easy to read and understandable format; and not require code translations. The credit report may not contain whiteouts, erasures, or alterations. The Mortgagee must retain copies of all credit reports.</p>
<p>The credit report must include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the name of the Mortgagee ordering the report;</li>
  <li>the name, address, and telephone number of the consumer-reporting agency;</li>
  <li>the name and SSN of each Borrower; and</li>
  <li>the primary repository from which any particular information was pulled, for each account listed.</li>
</ul>
<p>A truncated SSN is acceptable for FHA mortgage insurance purposes provided that the mortgage application captures the full nine-digit SSN.</p>
<p>The credit report must also include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>all inquiries made within the last 90 Days;</li>
  <li>all credit and legal information not considered obsolete under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), including information for the last seven years regarding:
    <ul>
      <li>bankruptcies;</li>
      <li>Judgments;</li>
      <li>lawsuits;</li>
      <li>foreclosures; and</li>
      <li>tax liens; and</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>for each Borrower debt listed:
    <ul>
      <li>the date the account was opened;</li>
      <li>high credit amount;</li>
      <li>required monthly payment amount;</li>
      <li>unpaid balance; and</li>
      <li>payment history.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>(2)	Updated Credit Report or Supplement to the Credit Report</h3>
<p>The Mortgagee must obtain an updated credit report or supplement if the underwriter identifies inconsistencies between any information in the mortgage file and the original credit report.</p>
<h3>(3)	Credit Information Not Listed on Credit Report</h3>
<p>A Mortgagee must develop credit information separately for any open debt listed on the mortgage application but not referenced in the credit report by using the procedures for Independent Verification of Non-Traditional Credit Providers.</p>
<h3>(4)	Specific Requirements for Residential Mortgage Credit Report</h3>
<p>In addition to meeting the general credit report requirements, the RMCR must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>provide a detailed account of the Borrower&rsquo;s employment history;</li>
  <li>verify each Borrower&rsquo;s current employment and income through an interview with the Borrower&rsquo;s employer or explain why such an interview was not completed;</li>
  <li>contain a statement attesting to the certification of employment for each Borrower and the date the information was verified; and</li>
  <li>report a credit history for each trade line within 90 Days of the credit report for each account with a balance.</li>
</ul>
<h3>(B)	Non-Traditional and Insufficient Credit (Manual)</h3>
<p>For Borrowers without a credit score, the Mortgagee must either obtain a Non-Traditional Mortgage Credit Report (NTMCR) from a credit reporting company or independently develop the Borrower&rsquo;s credit history using the requirements outlined below. </p>
<h3>(1)	Non-Traditional Mortgage Credit Report</h3>
<h3>(a)	Definition</h3>
<p>An NTMCR is designed to access the credit history of a Borrower who does not have the types of trade references that appear on a traditional credit report and used either as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a substitute for a TRMCR or an RMCR; or</li>
  <li>a supplement to a traditional credit report that has an insufficient number of trade items reported to generate a credit score.</li>
</ul>
<h3>(b)	Standard</h3>
<p>Mortgagees may use a NTMCR developed by a credit reporting agency that verifies the following information for all non-traditional credit references:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the existence of the credit providers;</li>
  <li>that the credit was actually extended to the Borrower; and</li>
  <li>the creditor has a published address or telephone number.</li>
</ul>
<p>The NTMCR must not include subjective statements such as &nbsp;&ldquo;satisfactory&rdquo; or &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo;, must be formatted in a similar fashion to traditional references, and provide the:</p>
<ul>
  <li>creditor&rsquo;s name;</li>
  <li>date of opening;</li>
  <li>high credit;</li>
  <li>current status of the account;</li>
  <li>12-month history of the account;</li>
  <li>required monthly payment;</li>
  <li>unpaid balance; and</li>
  <li>payment history in the delinquency categories (for example, 0x30 and 0x60).</li>
</ul>
<h3>(2)	Independent Verification of Non-Traditional Credit Providers</h3>
<p>The Mortgagee may independently verify the Borrower&rsquo;s credit references by documenting the existence of the credit provider and that the provider extended credit to the Borrower.</p>
<p>a.	To verify the existence of each credit provider, the Mortgagee must review public records from the state, county, or city or other documents providing a similar level of objective information.</p>
<p>b.	To verify credit information, the Mortgagee must:
  <ul>
  <li>use a published address or telephone number for the credit provider and not rely solely on information provided by the applicant; and</li>
  <li>obtain the most recent 12 months of canceled checks, or equivalent proof of payment, demonstrating the timing of payment to the credit provider.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>c.	To verify the Borrower&rsquo;s rental payment history, the Mortgagee must obtain a rental reference from the appropriate rental management company, provided the Borrower is not renting from a Family Member, demonstrating the timing of payment of the most recent 12 months in lieu of 12 months of canceled checks or equivalent proof of payment.</p>
<h3>(3)	Sufficiency of Credit References</h3>
<p>To be sufficient to establish the Borrower&rsquo;s credit, the credit history must include three credit references, including at least one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>rental housing payments (subject to independent verification if the Borrower is a renter);</li>
  <li>telephone service; or</li>
  <li>utility company reference (if not included in the rental housing payment), including:
    <ul>
      <li>gas;</li>
      <li>electricity;</li>
      <li>water;</li>
      <li>television service; or</li>
      <li>Internet service.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If the Mortgagee cannot obtain all three credit references from the list above, the Mortgagee may use the following sources of unreported recurring debt:</p>
<ul>

  <li>insurance premiums not payroll deducted (for example, medical, auto, life, renter's insurance);</li>
  <li>payment to child care providers made to businesses that provide such services;</li>
  <li>school tuition;</li>
  <li>retail store credit cards (for example, from department, furniture, appliance stores, or specialty stores);</li>
  <li>rent-to-own (for example, furniture, appliances);</li>
  <li>payment of that part of medical bills not covered by insurance;</li>
  <li>a documented 12-month history of savings evidenced by regular deposits resulting in an increased balance to the account that:
    <ul>
      <li>were made at least quarterly;</li>
      <li>were not payroll deducted, and;</li>
      <li>caused no insufficient funds (NSF) checks;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>an automobile lease;</li>
  <li>a personal loan from an individual with repayment terms in writing and supported by canceled checks to document the payments; or</li>
  <li>a documented 12-month history of payment by the Borrower on an account for which the Borrower is an authorized user.</li>
</ul>
<h3>iii.	Evaluating Credit History (Manual)</h3>
<h3>(A)	General Credit (Manual)</h3>
<p>The underwriter must examine the Borrower&rsquo;s overall pattern of credit behavior, not just isolated unsatisfactory or slow payments, to determine the Borrower&rsquo;s creditworthiness.</p>
<p>The Mortgagee must not consider the credit history of a non-borrowing spouse.</p>
<h3>(B)	Types of Payment Histories (Manual)</h3>
<p>The underwriter must evaluate the Borrower&rsquo;s payment histories in the following order: (1) previous housing expenses and related expenses, including utilities; (2) installment debts; and (3) revolving accounts.</p>

<p>The underwriter may consider a Borrower to have an acceptable payment history if the Borrower has made all housing and installment debt payments on time for the previous 12 months and has no more than two 30-Day late Mortgage Payments or installment payments in the previous 24 months.</p>
<p>The underwriter may approve the Borrower with an acceptable payment history if the Borrower has no major derogatory credit on revolving accounts in the previous 12 months.</p>
<p>Major derogatory credit on revolving accounts must include any payments made more than 90 Days after the due date, or three or more payments more than 60 Days after the due date.</p>
<h3>(2)	Payment History Requiring Additional Analysis</h3>
<p>If a Borrower&rsquo;s credit history does not reflect satisfactory credit as stated above, the Borrower&rsquo;s payment history requires additional analysis.</p>
<p>The Mortgagee must analyze the Borrower&rsquo;s delinquent accounts to determine whether late payments were based on a disregard for financial obligations, an inability to manage debt, or extenuating circumstances. The Mortgagee must document this analysis in the mortgage file. Any explanation or documentation of delinquent accounts must be consistent with other information in the file.</p>
<p>The underwriter may only approve a Borrower with a credit history not meeting the satisfactory credit history above if the underwriter has documented the delinquency was related to extenuating circumstances.</p>

</ul>
<p>The Mortgagee must verify and document the previous 12 months&rsquo; housing history. For Borrowers who indicate they are living rent-free, the Mortgagee must obtain verification from the property owner where they are residing that the Borrower has been living rent-free and the amount of time the Borrower has been living rent free.</p>
<p>A Mortgage that has been modified must utilize the payment history in accordance with the modification agreement for the time period of modification in determining late housing payments.</p>
