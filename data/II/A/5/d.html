<p>The Direct Endorsement (DE) underwriter is ultimately responsible for making an underwriting decision on behalf of their DE Mortgagee in compliance with HUD requirements.</p>
<h3>i.	Duty of Care/Due Diligence (Manual)</h3>
<p>The underwriter must exercise the same level of care that would be used in underwriting a Mortgage entirely dependent on the Property as security. Compliance with FHA requirements is deemed to be the minimum standard of due diligence required in originating and underwriting an FHA-insured Mortgage.</p>
<h3>ii.	Specific Underwriter Responsibilities (Manual)</h3>
<p>The underwriter must review each Mortgage as a separate and unique transaction, recognizing that there may be multiple factors that demonstrate a Borrower&rsquo;s ability and willingness to make timely Mortgage Payments to make an underwriting decision on behalf of their DE Mortgagee in compliance with HUD requirements. The underwriter must evaluate the totality of the Borrower&rsquo;s circumstances and the impact of layering risks on the probability that a Borrower will be able to repay the mortgage obligation according to the terms of the Mortgage.</p>
<p>As the responsible party, the underwriter must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>review appraisal reports, compliance inspections, and credit analyses to ensure reasonable conclusions, sound reports, and compliance with HUD requirements regardless of who prepared the documentation;</li>
  <li>determine the acceptability of the appraisal, the inspections, the Borrower&rsquo;s capacity to repay the Mortgage, and the overall acceptability of the Mortgage for FHA insurance;</li>
  <li>identify any inconsistencies in information obtained by the Mortgagee in the course of reviewing the Borrower's application regardless of the materiality of such information to the origination and underwriting of a Mortgage; and</li>
  <li>resolve all inconsistencies identified before approving the Borrower&rsquo;s application, and document the inconsistencies and their resolutions of the inconsistencies in the file.</li>
</ul>
<p>The underwriter must identify and report any misrepresentations, violations of HUD requirements, and fraud to the appropriate party within their organization.</p>
<h3>iii.	Underwriting of Credit and Debt (Manual)</h3>
<p>The underwriter must determine the creditworthiness of the Borrower, which includes analyzing the Borrower's overall pattern of credit behavior and the credit report (see Credit Requirements).</p>
<p>The lack of traditional credit history or the Borrower's decision to not use credit may not be used as the sole basis for rejecting the mortgage application.</p>
<p>Compensating factors cannot be used to compensate for any derogatory credit.</p>
<p>The underwriter must ensure that there are no other unpaid obligations incurred in connection with the mortgage transaction or the purchase of the Property.</p>
<h3>iv.	Underwriting of Income (Manual)</h3>
<p>The underwriter must review the income of a Borrower and verify that it has been supported with the proper documentation (see Income Requirements). </p>
<h3>v.	Underwriting of Assets (Manual)</h3>
<p>The underwriter must review the assets of a Borrower and verify that they have been supported with the proper documentation (see Asset Requirements).</p>
<h3>vi.	Verifying Mortgage Insurance Premium and Mortgage Amount (Manual)</h3>
<p>The underwriter must review the MIP and mortgage amount and verify that they have been supported with the proper documentation (see Underwriting).</p>
<h3>vii.	Calculating Qualifying Ratios (Manual)</h3>
<h4>(A)	General Information about Qualifying Ratios</h4>
<p>For all transactions, except non-credit qualifying Streamline Refinances, the underwriter must calculate the Borrower&rsquo;s Total Mortgage Payment to Effective Income Ratio (PTI) and the Total Fixed Payment to Effective Income ratio, or DTI, and verify compliance with the ratio requirements listed in the Approvable Ratio Requirements Chart. </p>
<p>The Mortgagee must exclude any obligation that is wholly secured by existing assets of the Borrower from the calculation of the Borrower&rsquo;s debts, provided the assets securing the debt are also not considered in qualifying the Borrower.</p>
<h4>(B)	Calculating Total Mortgage Payment</h4>
<p>The total Mortgage Payment includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>P&I;</li>
  <li>real estate taxes;</li>
  <li>hazard insurance;</li>
  <li>flood insurance as applicable;</li>
  <li>MIP;</li>
  <li>HOA or condominium association fees or expenses;</li>
  <li>Ground Rent;</li>
  <li>special assessments, including any assessments related to a PACE obligation;</li>
  <li>payments for any acceptable secondary financing; and</li>
  <li>any other escrow payments.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Mortgagee may deduct the amount of the Mortgage Credit Certificate or Section 8 Homeownership Voucher if it is paid directly to the Servicer.</p>
<h5>(1)	Estimating Real Estate Taxes</h5>
<p>The Mortgagee must use accurate estimates of monthly tax escrows when calculating the total Mortgage Payment.</p>
<p>In New Construction cases and Manufactured Homes converting to real estate, property tax estimates must be based on the land and improvements.</p>
<p>Where real estate taxes are abated, Mortgagees may use the abated amount provided that (1) the Mortgagee can document the abated amount with the taxing authority and (2) the abatement will remain in place for at least the first three years of the Mortgage.</p>
<h5>(2)	Condominium Utility Expenses</h5>
<p>The portion of a condominium fee that is clearly attributable to utilities may be subtracted from the HOA fees before computing qualifying ratios, provided the Borrower provides proper documentation, such as statements from the utility company.</p>
<h5>(3)	Temporary Interest Rate Buydowns</h5>
<p>The Mortgagee must use the Note rate when calculating principle and interest for Mortgages that involve a temporary interest rate buydown.</p>
<h4>(C)	Calculating Total Fixed Payment</h4>
<p> The total fixed payment includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the total Mortgage Payment; and</li>
  <li>monthly obligations on all debts and liabilities.</li>
</ul>
<h3>viii.	Approvable Ratio Requirements (Manual)</h3>
<p>The maximum Total Mortgage Payment to Effective Income Ratio (PTI) and Total Fixed Payments to Effective Income Ratio, or DTI, applicable to manually underwritten Mortgages are summarized in the matrix below.</p>
<p>The qualifying ratios for Borrowers with no credit score are computed using income only from Borrowers occupying the Property and obligated on the Mortgage. Non-occupant co-Borrower income may not be included.</p>

<h3>ix.	Documenting Acceptable Compensating Factors (Manual)</h3>
<p>The following describes the compensating factors and required documentation that may be used to justify approval of manually underwritten Mortgages with qualifying ratios as described above.</p>
<h4>(A)	Energy Efficient Homes</h4>
<h5>(1)	Standard</h5>
<p>For Mortgages on New Construction, the Borrower is eligible for the EEH stretch ratios when the property meets or exceeds the higher of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the 2006 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC);</li>
  <li>any successor energy code standard that has been adopted by HUD for its Minimum Property Standard (MPS); or</li>
  <li>the applicable IECC year used by the state or local building code.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Mortgages on Existing Construction, the Borrower is eligible for the EEH stretch ratios when the property meets either of the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Homes that currently score a '6' or higher on the Home Energy Score scale; or</li>
  <li>Homes where documented cost-effective energy improvements, as identified in the Home Energy Score Report, would increase a home's score to a '6' or higher are completed prior to closing, or in association with FHA's 203(k), Weatherization, EEM or Solar and Wind programs.</li>
</ul>
<h5>(2)	Required Documentation</h5>
<p>The following documents must be included in the case binder submitted for endorsement:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For Mortgages on Existing Construction, a copy of the Home Energy Score Report.</li>
  <li>For Mortgages on New Construction, a copy of the Builder's Certification, form HUD-92541, to evidence the IECC code, successor code or local/state building code used.</li>
</ul>
<h4>(B)	Verified and Documented Cash Reserves</h4>
<p>Verified and documented cash Reserves may be cited as a compensating factor subject to the following requirements.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reserves are equal to or exceed three total monthly Mortgage Payments (one and two units); or</li>
  <li>Reserves are equal to or exceed six total monthly Mortgage Payments (three and four units).</li>
</ul>

<p>Reserves are calculated as the Borrower's total assets as described in Asset Requirements less:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the total funds required to close the Mortgage;</li>
  <li>gifts;</li>
  <li>borrowed funds; and</li>
  <li>cash received at closing in a cash-out refinance transaction or incidental cash received at closing in the mortgage transaction.</li>
</ul>
<h4>(C)	Minimal Increase in Housing Payment</h4>
<p>A minimal increase in housing payment may be cited as a compensating factor subject to the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the new total monthly Mortgage Payment does not exceed the current total monthly housing payment by more than $100 or 5 percent, whichever is less; and</li>
  <li>there is a documented 12 month housing payment history with no more than one 30 Day late payment. In cash-out transactions all payments on the Mortgage being refinanced must have been made within the month due for the previous 12 months.</li>
  <li>If the Borrower has no current housing payment Mortgagees may not cite this compensating factor.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Current Total Monthly Housing Payment refers to the Borrower's current total Mortgage Payment or current total monthly rent obligation.</p>
<h4>(D)	No Discretionary Debt</h4>
<p>No discretionary debt may be cited as a compensating factor subject to the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the Borrower's housing payment is the only open account with an outstanding balance that is not paid off monthly;</li>
  <li>the credit report shows established credit lines in the Borrower's name open for at least six months; and</li>
  <li>the Borrower can document that these accounts have been paid off in full monthly for at least the past six months.</li>
</ul>
<p>Borrowers who have no established credit other than their housing payment, no other credit lines in their own name open for at least six months, or who cannot document that all other accounts are paid off in full monthly for at least the past six months, do not qualify under this criterion. Credit lines not in the Borrower's name but for which they are an authorized user do not qualify under this criterion.</p>
<h4>(E)	Significant Additional Income Not Reflected in Effective Income</h4>
<p>Additional income from Overtime, Bonuses, Part-Time or Seasonal Employment that is not reflected in Effective Income can be cited as a compensating factor subject to the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the Mortgagee must verify and document that the Borrower has received this income for at least one year, and it will likely continue; and</li>
  <li>the income, if it were included in gross Effective Income, is sufficient to reduce the qualifying ratios to not more than 37/47.</li>
</ul>
<p>Income from non-borrowing spouses or other parties not obligated for the Mortgage may not be counted under this criterion.</p>
<p>This compensating factor may be cited only in conjunction with another compensating factor when qualifying ratios exceed 37/47 but are not more than 40/50.</p>
<h4>(F)	Residual Income</h4>
<p>Residual income may be cited as a compensating factor provided it can be documented and it is at least equal to the applicable amounts for household size and geographic region found on the Table of Residual Incomes By Region found in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Lenders Handbook - VA Pamphlet 26-7, Chapter 4.9 b and e.</p>
<h5>(1)	Calculating Residual Income</h5>
<p>Residual income is calculated as total Effective Income of all occupying Borrowers less:</p>
<ul>
  <li>state income taxes;</li>
  <li>federal income taxes;</li>
  <li>municipal or other income taxes;
  <li>retirement or Social Security;</li>
  <li>total fixed payment;</li>
  <li>estimated maintenance and utilities;</li>
  <li>job related expenses (e.g., child care); and</li>
  <li>the amount of the Gross Up of any Non-Taxable Income.</li>
</ul>
<p>If available, Mortgagees must use federal and state tax returns from the most recent tax year to document state and local taxes, retirement, Social Security and Medicare. If tax returns are not available, Mortgagees may rely upon current pay stubs.</p>
<p>For estimated maintenance and utilities, Mortgagees must multiply the Gross Living Area of the Property by the maintenance and utility factor found in the Lenders Handbook - VA Pamphlet 26-7.</p>
<h5>(2)	Using Residual Income as a Compensating Factor</h5>
<p>To use residual income as a compensating factor, the Mortgagee must count all members of the household of the occupying Borrower without regard to the nature of their relationship and without regard to whether they are joining on title or the Note to determine 'family size.'</p>
<h5>Exception</h5>
<p>The Mortgagee may omit any individuals from &ldquo;family size&rdquo; who are fully supported from a source of verified income which is not included in Effective Income in the mortgage analysis. These individuals must voluntarily provide sufficient documentation to verify their income to qualify for this exception.</p>
<p>From the table provided in Lenders Handbook - VA Pamphlet 26-7, select the applicable mortgage amount, region and household size. If residual income equals or exceeds the corresponding amount on the table, it may be cited as a compensating factor.</p>
