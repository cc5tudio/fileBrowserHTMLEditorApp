<h5>(4)	Policy on Use of Electronic Signatures</h5>
<h6>(a)	Definition</h6>
<p>An Electronic Signature refers to any electronic sound, symbol, or process attached to or logically associated with a contract or record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record. FHA does not accept an electronic signature that is solely voice or audio. Digital signatures are a subset of electronic signatures.</p>
<h6>(b)	Use of Electronic Signatures</h6>
<p>An electronic signature conducted in accordance with the Electronic Signature Performance Standards (Performance Standards) is accepted on FHA documents requiring signatures to be included in the case binder for mortgage insurance, unless otherwise prohibited by law.</p>
<p>Electronic Signatures meeting the Performance Standards are treated as equivalent to handwritten signatures.</p>
<h6>(c)	Electronic Signature Performance Standards</h6>
<p>The Performance Standards are the set of guidelines that govern FHA acceptance of an electronic signature. The use of electronic signatures is voluntary. However, Mortgagees choosing to use electronic signatures must fully comply with the Performance Standards.</p>
<h6>(i)	The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-SIGN Act) Compliance and Technology</h6>
<p>A Mortgagee&rsquo;s electronic signature technology must comply with all requirements of the E-SIGN Act, including those relating to disclosures, consent, signature, presentation, delivery, retention and any state law applicable to the transaction.</p>
<h6>(ii)	Third Party Documents</h6>
<p>Third Party Documents are those documents that are originated and signed outside of the control of the Mortgagee, such as the sales contract. FHA will accept electronic signatures on Third Party Documents included in the case binder for mortgage insurance endorsement in accordance with the E-SIGN Act and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA). An indication of the electronic signature and date should be clearly visible when viewed electronically and in a paper copy of the electronically signed document.</p>
<h6>(iii)	Authorized Documents</h6>
<p>Authorized Documents refer to the documents on which FHA accepts electronic signatures provided that the Mortgagee complies with the Performance Standards.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Mortgage Insurance Endorsement Documents:</b> Electronic signatures will be accepted on all documents requiring signatures included in the case binder for mortgage insurance except the Note. FHA will accept electronic signatures on the Note for forward Mortgages only. FHA will not accept electronic signatures on HECM Notes.</li>

    <li><b>Servicing and Loss Mitigation Documentation:</b> Electronic signatures will be accepted on any documents associated with servicing or loss mitigation services for FHA-insured Mortgages.</li>

    <li><b>FHA Insurance Claim Documentation:</b> Electronic signatures will be accepted on any documents associated with the filing of a claim for FHA insurance benefits, including form HUD-27011, Single Family Application for Insurance Benefits.</li>

    <li><b>HUD Real Estate Owned (REO) Documents:</b> Electronic signatures will be accepted on the HUD REO Sales Contract and related addenda.</li>
</ul>
<h6>(iv)	Associating an Electronic Signature with the Authorized Document</h6>
<p>The Mortgagee must ensure that the process for electronically signing authorized documents provide for the document to be presented to the signatory before an electronic signature is obtained. The Mortgagee must ensure that the electronic signature is attached to, or logically associated with, the document that has been electronically signed.</p>
<h6>(v)	Intent to Sign</h6>
<p>The Mortgagee must be able to prove that the signer certified that the document is true, accurate, and correct at the time signed. Electronic signatures are only valid under the E-SIGN Act if they are &ldquo;executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record.&nbsp; Establishing intent includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>identifying the purpose for the Borrower signing the electronic record;</li>
    <li>being reasonably certain that the Borrower knows which electronic record is being signed; and</li>
    <li>providing notice to the Borrower that their electronic signature is about to be applied to, or associated with, the electronic record.</li>
</ul>   
<p>Intent to use an electronic signature may be established by, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>an online dialog box or alert advising the Borrower that continuing the process will result in an electronic signature;</li>
    <li>an online dialog box or alert indicating that an electronic signature has just been created and giving the Borrower an opportunity to confirm or cancel the signature; or</li>
    <li>a click-through agreement advising the Borrower that continuing the process will result in an electronic signature.</li>
</ul>
<h6>(vi)	Single Use of Signature</h6>
<p>Mortgagees must require a separate action by the signer, evidencing intent to sign, in each location where a signature or initials are to be applied.</p>
<p>This provision does not apply to documents signed by Mortgagee employees or Mortgagee contractors provided the Mortgagee obtains the consent of the individual for the use of their electronic signature. The Mortgagee must document the employee&rsquo;s or contractor&rsquo;s consent.</p>
<h6>(vii)	Authentication</h6>
<h6>Definition</h6>
<p>Authentication refers to the process used to confirm a signer&rsquo;s identity as a party in a transaction.</p>
<h6>Standard for Authentication</h6>

<ul>
    <li>national commercial credit bureaus;</li>
    <li>commercially available data sources or services;</li>
    <li>state motor vehicle agencies; or</li>

<h6>Standard for Attribution</h6>
<p>The Mortgagee must maintain evidence sufficient to establish that the electronic signature may be attributed to the individual purported to have signed.</p>
<p>The Mortgagee must use one of the following methods, or combinations of methods, to establish attribution:</p>
<ul>
    <li>selection by or assignment to the individual of a Personal Identification Number (PIN), password, or other shared secret, that the individual uses as part of the signature process;</li>
    <li>delivery of a credential to the individual by a trusted third party, used either to sign electronically or to prevent undetected alteration after the electronic signature using another method;</li>
    <li>knowledge base authentication using &ldquo;out of band/wallet&rdquo; information;</li>
    <li>measurement of some unique biometric attribute of the individual and creation of a computer file that represents the measurement, together with procedures to protect against disclosure of the associated computer file to unauthorized parties; or</li>
    <li>public key cryptography.</li>
</ul>
<h6>(ix)	Credential Loss Management</h6>
<p>Mortgagees must have a system in place to ensure the security of all issued credentials. One or a combination of the following loss management controls is acceptable:</p>
<ul>
    <li>maintaining the uniqueness of each combined identification code and password, such that no two individuals have the same combination of identification code and password;</li>
    <li>ensuring that identification code and password issuances are periodically checked, recalled, or revised;</li>
    <li>following loss management procedures to electronically de-authorize lost, stolen, missing, or otherwise compromised identification code or password information, and to issue temporary or permanent replacements using suitable, rigorous controls;</li>
    <li>using transaction safeguards to prevent unauthorized use of passwords or identification codes; or</li>
    <li>detecting and reporting any attempts at unauthorized use of the password or identification code to the system security unit.</li>
</ul>

<h6>(d)	Required Documentation and Integrity of Records</h6>

<p>Mortgagees must ensure that they employ industry-standard encryption to protect the signer&rsquo;s signature and the integrity of the documents to which it is affixed. Mortgagees must ensure that their systems will detect and record any tampering with the electronically signed documents. FHA will not accept documents that show evidence of tampering.</p>

<p>If changes to the document are made, the electronic process must be designed to provide an &ldquo;audit trail&rdquo; showing all alterations, the date and time they were made, and identify who made them.</p>

<p>The Mortgagee&rsquo;s system must be designed so that the signed document is designated as the Authoritative Copy. The Authoritative Copy of an electronically signed document refers to the electronic record that is designated by the Mortgagee or holder as the controlling reference copy.</p>

<p>In order to obtain a case number, the Mortgagee must:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide the subject Borrower&rsquo;s name, SSN, and date of birth;</li>
<li>provide the property address; and</li>
<li>certify that the Mortgagee has an active mortgage application for the subject Borrower and Property.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Mortgagee is not required to input appraiser information at the time the case number is ordered.</p>
<h6>(a)	Automated Data Processing Codes</h6>
<p>FHA Automated Data Processing (ADP) Codes are derived from the section of the National Housing Act under which the Mortgage is to be insured. The Mortgagee must select the correct ADP code for each Mortgage in FHAC.
</p>
<h6>(b)	 Case Numbers on Sponsored Originations</h6>
<p>The Mortgagee will not be able to order case numbers for sponsored originations unless their sponsored TPO has been registered in FHAC.</p>
<h5>(2)	Holds Tracking</h5>
<p>If FHAC detects that a case number currently exists for the Property, a case number will not be assigned. The Mortgagee will receive notification that the case number assignment has been placed in Holds Tracking. The Mortgagee must review the Holds Tracking screen in FHAC to determine the necessary actions to obtain a case number.</p>
<h5>(3)	Canceling and Reinstating Case Numbers</h5>
<h6>(a)	Canceling a Case Number</h6>
<p>The Mortgagee may request cancellation of a case number by submitting a request to HUD. A case number will be canceled only if:</p>
<ul>
	<li>an appraisal has not been completed and the Borrower will not close the Mortgage as an FHA-insured Mortgage;</li>
	<li>FHA mortgage insurance will not be sought; or</li>
	<li>the appraisal has already expired.</li>
</ul>
<p> The Mortgagee must submit a request for cancellation to the FHA Resource Center at answers@hud.gov using the Case Cancellation Request Template.</p>
<h6>(b)	Automatic Case Number Cancellations</h6>
<p>Case numbers are automatically canceled after six months if one of the following actions is not performed as a last action:</p>
<ul>
	<li>appraisal information entered;</li>
	<li>Firm Commitment issued by FHA;</li>
	<li>insurance application received and subsequent updates; or</li>
	<li>Notices of Return (NOR) or resubmissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Updates to the Borrower&rsquo;s name and/or property address, an appraisal update, or a transmission of the Upfront Mortgage Insurance Premium (UFMIP) do not constitute Last Action Taken.</p>
<h6>(c)	Reinstatement of Case Numbers</h6>
<p>The Mortgagee may request reinstatement of canceled case numbers by submitting a request to the FHA Resource Center using the Case Reinstatement Request Template.</p>
<p>Case numbers that were automatically canceled will be reinstated only if the Mortgagee provides evidence that the subject Mortgage closed prior to cancellation of the case number, such as a Closing Disclosure or similar legal document.</p>
<h5>(4)	Transferring Case Numbers</h5>
<h6>(a)	Requirements for the Transferring Mortgagee</h6>
<p>The original Mortgagee must assign the case number to the new Mortgagee using the Case Transfer function in FHAC immediately upon the Borrower&rsquo;s request.</p>
<p>The original Mortgagee may provide processing documents but is not required to do so.</p>
<p>The original Mortgagee may not charge the Borrower for the transfer of any documents, but the original Mortgagee may negotiate a fee with the new Mortgagee for providing the processing documents. The original Mortgagee is never entitled to a fee for the transfer of processing documents for a Streamline Refinance.</p>
<h6>(b)	Case Number Transfer Involving a Rejected Mortgage</h6>
<p>If the transfer involves a rejected Mortgage, the original Mortgagee must complete the Mortgage Credit Reject function in FHAC prior to transferring the Mortgage.</p>
<h6>(c)	Case Number Transfer Involving a Sponsored Third-Party Originator</h6>
<p>Where a case number is transferred to a new approved Mortgagee or sponsored TPO, the original Mortgagee, its authorized agent, or sponsored TPO that is also an FHA-approved Mortgagee must complete the appropriate sections in FHAC as described in the FHAC Guide &ndash; Case Processing Support Functions.</p>
<h5>(5)	Ordering Title Commitments</h5>
<p>The Mortgagee must order a title commitment to ensure the Property will be properly titled and the Mortgage secured in accordance with FHA requirements.</p>
<h5>(6)	Ordering Appraisals</h5>

<h6>(a)	Appraisal Integrity</h6>
<p>The Mortgagee is responsible for identifying any problems or potential problems with the integrity, accuracy and thoroughness of an appraisal submitted to FHA for mortgage insurance purposes.</p>
<p>Appraisers must comply with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP), including the Competency Rule, when conducting appraisals of Properties intended as security for FHA-insured financing. In appraising any Property for the purpose of obtaining FHA mortgage insurance, the Appraiser must certify that they are capable of performing the appraisal because they have the necessary qualifications and access to all necessary data.</p>
<p>The Mortgagee must ensure that FHA is listed on the appraisal report as an Intended User of the appraisal.</p>

<p>The Mortgagee may not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, disability, or actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity in the selection of an Appraiser.</p>
<h6>(c)	Use of Appraisal Management Company or Third-Party Contractors</h6>
<p>The Mortgagee may engage an Appraisal Management Company (AMC) to perform services related to the obtaining of an appraisal. The Mortgagee remains responsible for the acts of its AMC or third-party contractors.</p>
<p> The Mortgagee may not pay the AMC and other third-party contractors fees in excess of what is customary and reasonable for such services in the market area where the Property being appraised is located. Any management fees must be for actual services related to the ordering process, or review of appraisal for FHA financing.</p>
<h6>(d)	Appraiser Independence</h6>
<p>The Mortgagee must ensure it does not compromise the Appraiser&rsquo;s independence.</p>
<p>The Mortgagee may not allow the Appraiser to be selected, retained, managed, or compensated by a mortgage broker or any member of a Mortgagee&rsquo;s staff who is compensated on a commission basis tied to the successful completion of a Mortgage or who is not independent of the Mortgagee&rsquo;s mortgage production staff or processes.</p>
<p>The Mortgagee must ensure that it does not:</p>

    <li>withhold or threaten to withhold timely payment or partial payment for an appraisal report;</li>
    <li>prohibit the Appraiser from recording the fee paid for the performance of the appraisal in the appraisal report;</li>

        <ul>
            <li>there is a reasonable basis to believe that the initial appraisal was flawed or tainted and such belief is clearly and appropriately noted in the mortgage file; or</li>
            <li>such appraisal or AVM was completed pursuant to written, pre-established bona fide pre- or post-Disbursement appraisal review or quality control process or underwriting guidelines and the Mortgagee adheres to a policy of selecting the most reliable appraisal, rather than the appraisal that states the highest value;</li>
        </ul>
    <li>withhold or threaten to withhold future business from an Appraiser, or demote or terminate or threaten to demote or terminate an Appraiser in order to influence an Appraiser to arrive at a predetermined or desired value;</li>
    <li>make expressed or implied promises of future business, promotions or increased compensation for an Appraiser in order to influence an Appraiser to arrive at a predetermined or desired value;</li>
    <li>allow the removal of an Appraiser from a list of qualified Appraisers or the addition of an Appraiser to an exclusionary list of qualified Appraisers, used by any Entity, without prompt written notice to such Appraiser.

    <li>perform any other act or practice that impairs or attempts to impair an Appraiser&rsquo;s independence, objectivity, or impartiality, or that violates any applicable law, regulation, or requirement.</li>
</ul>
<h6>(e)	Additional Requirements When Ordering an Appraisal</h6>

If the original Mortgagee has not been reimbursed for the cost of the appraisal, the Mortgagee is not required to transfer the appraisal until it is reimbursed.</p>
<p>The second Mortgagee may not request the Appraiser to re-address the appraisal. If the second Mortgagee finds deficiencies in the appraisal, the Mortgagee must order a new appraisal.</p>
