		<!-- <h3>Endorsement and Post-Endorsement</h3> -->
		<h3>i.	Endorsement</h3>
		<p>Upon successful completion of a pre-endorsement review either by FHA or the LI Mortgagee, an electronic Mortgage Insurance Certificate (MIC) will be issued.</p>
		<p>The Mortgage becomes insured on the date the MIC is issued. </p>
		<h3>ii.	Post-Endorsement</h3>
		<h4>(A)	Confirming Status of the Mortgage Insurance Certificate</h4>
		<p>The Mortgagee can confirm the endorsement status of a Mortgage using FHAC or FHA Connection Business to Government (FHAC-B2G) application. </p>
		<h4>(B)	Obtaining the Mortgage Insurance Certificate</h4>
		<p>When requesting the MIC, the Mortgagee must specify whether it is to be prepared in the name of the originator (principal), or authorized agent, as it appears in HUD Systems. </p>
		<p>The MIC will be issued electronically. The Mortgagee can download and print copies of the MIC as needed.</p>
		<h4>(C)	Corrections to the Mortgage Insurance Certificate</h4>
		<p>To obtain a correction to the MIC, the Mortgagee must submit the MIC Correction Request Template to the FHA Resource Center. This form may be used to correct the property address, Borrower name, ADP Code, maturity and first payments dates, P&I, interest rate, SSN, FHA case number, mortgage amount or other information contained in the MIC, or to add a co-Borrower.</p>
		<h4>(D)	Corrections to Original Instruments</h4>
		<p>The Mortgagee must follow applicable local law when making corrections to the original instruments.</p>
		<p>If new instruments are executed as required by local law, the Mortgagee must submit the new instruments prior to insurance endorsement.</p>
		<h4>(E)	Partial Release of Security</h4>
		<p>FHA approval for partial release of security is required except in limited circumstances. See FHA Servicing Policy for more information.</p>
		<h3>iii.	Case Binder Submission &ndash; Lender Insurance Mortgagees</h3>
		<p>LI Mortgagees must submit the case binder to the Jurisdictional HOC (or other HUD office as identified in the notice) when requested by FHA. </p>
		<p>FHA will request the case binder through a daily email notification to the Mortgagee&rsquo;s contact person. </p>
		<p>If requested, the LI Mortgagee must submit the case binder within 10 business days of request.</p>
		<p>If approved to submit electronic Case Binders (eCBs) to FHA, the LI Mortgagee must submit the eCB through FHAC through the Insuring, Underwriting Report, and Lender Letter screens.</p>
		<h3>iv.	Mortgage File Retention</h3>
		<p>The Mortgagee must maintain their mortgage file, including the case binder, in either hard copy or electronic format for a period of two years from the date of endorsement. </p>
		<p>Mortgagees retaining eCBs are not required to maintain a separate version of the eCB indexed for electronic submission to HUD. </p>
		<p>If HUD requests a case binder that is maintained electronically, the Mortgagee must follow the requirements in the eCB Developer&rsquo;s Guide.</p>
