<p>Effective for case numbers assigned on or after September 14, 2015</p>
<p>All Properties with pending Mortgages or endorsements in Presidentially-Declared Major Disaster Areas (PDMDA) must have a damage inspection report that identifies and quantifies any dwelling damage. The damage inspection report must be completed by an FHA Roster Appraiser even if the inspection shows no damage to the Property, and the report must be dated after the Incident Period (as defined by FEMA). FHA does not require a specific form for a damage inspection report.</p>
<p>Streamline Refinances are allowed to proceed to closing and/or endorsement without any additional requirements.</p>
<p>FHA does not require the Appraiser to ensure utilities are on at the time of this inspection if they have not yet been restored for the area.</p>
<p>Damage inspections should be completed by the original Appraiser. However, if the original Appraiser is not available, another FHA Roster Appraiser in good standing with geographic competence in the affected market may be used. If the Mortgagee uses a different Appraiser to inspect the Property, the Appraiser performing the damage inspection must be provided with a complete copy of the original appraisal.</p>
<p>All damages must be repaired by licensed contractors or per local jurisdictional requirements. All damages, regardless of amount, must be repaired and the Property restored to pre-loss condition with appropriate and applicable documentation.</p>

<h3>iii. Pre-Closing Appraisal Validity in Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>For Mortgages that are not closed prior to the Incident Period, as defined by FEMA, in PDMDAs where a damage inspection report reveals property damage, the appraisal validity period is extended from 120 Days to a maximum of one year from the effective date of the original appraisal.</p>

<p>In no instance will an appraisal be acceptable for a mortgage closing that has an effective date beyond one year. Mortgages with appraisals having effective dates in excess of one year require a new appraisal.</p>
