<p>FHA collects a one-time Upfront Mortgage Insurance Premium (UFMIP) and an annual insurance premium, also referred to as the periodic or monthly MIP, which is collected in monthly installments.</p>
<h3>i.	Upfront Mortgage Insurance Premium</h3>
<h3>(A)	Upfront Mortgage Insurance Premium Amount</h3>
<p>Most FHA mortgage insurance programs require the payment of UFMIP, which may be financed into the Mortgage. The UFMIP is not considered when calculating the area-based Nationwide Mortgage Limits and LTV limits.</p>
<p>The UFMIP charged for all amortization terms is 175 Basis Points (bps), unless otherwise stated in the applicable Programs and Products or in the MIP chart.</p>
<p>The UFMIP must be entirely financed into the Mortgage or paid entirely in cash. Any UFMIP amounts paid in cash are added to the total cash settlement requirements. However, if the UFMIP is financed into the Mortgage, the entire amount is to be financed except for any amount less than $1.00.</p>
<p>The mortgage amount must be rounded down to the nearest whole dollar amount, regardless of whether the UFMIP is financed or paid in cash.</p>
<h3>(B)	Refund and Credit of Upfront Mortgage Insurance Premium</h3>
<p>The UFMIP is not refundable, except in connection with the refinancing to a new FHA-insured Mortgage. See the Refinances Section.</p>
<h3>ii.	Annual (or Periodic) Mortgage Insurance Premium</h3>
<p>The periodic MIP is an annual MIP that is payable monthly. The amount of the annual MIP is based on the LTV ratio, Base Loan Amount and the term of the Mortgage.</p>
<h3>Calculation of the MIP</h3>
<p>The MIP rate and duration of the MIP assessment period vary by mortgage term, Base Loan Amount, and LTV ratio for the Mortgage, as shown in the MIP chart.</p>
