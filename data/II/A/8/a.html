<h3>i. Overview</h3>
<p>The Section 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgage Insurance Program is used to:</p>
<ul>
        <li>rehabilitate an existing one- to four-unit Structure, which will be used primarily for residential purposes;</li>
        <li>rehabilitate such a Structure and refinance outstanding indebtedness on the Structure and the Real Property on which the Structure is located; or</li>
        <li>purchase and rehabilitate a Structure and purchase the Real Property on which the Structure is located.</li>
</ul>
<p>Structure refers to a building that has a roof and walls, and stands permanently in one place that contains single or multiple housing units that are used for human habitation.</p>

<p>Mortgages to be insured under Section 203(k) must be processed and underwritten in accordance with the requirements in Origination Through Post-Closing/Endorsement, except where noted otherwise in this appendix.</p>

<h4>(A)  Types of 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgages</h4>
<p>There are two types of 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgages: Standard 203(k) and Limited 203(k), as described below. The guidance in this appendix is applicable to both Standard 203(k) and Limited 203(k) Mortgages unless noted otherwise.</p>
<h5>(1)  Standard 203(k)</h5>
<p>The Standard 203(k) Mortgage may be used for remodeling and repairs. There is a minimum repair cost of $5,000 and the use of a 203(k) Consultant is required.</p>
<h5>(2)  Limited 203(k)</h5>
<p>The Limited 203(k) may only be used for minor remodeling and non-structural repairs. The Limited 203(k) does not require the use of a 203(k) Consultant, but a Consultant may be used. The total rehabilitation cost must not exceed $35,000. There is no minimum rehabilitation cost.</p>
<h4>(B)  Eligible Supplemental Programs and Products</h4>
<p>A 203(k) Mortgage may be used in conjunction with the following:</p>
<ul>
        <li>Section 203(h) Mortgage Insurance for Disaster Victims</li>
        <li>Energy Efficient Mortgages</li>
        <li>Solar and Wind Technologies</li>
</ul>
<h3>ii. Borrower Eligibility</h3>

<p>The Borrower must meet the eligibility requirements found in the Borrower Eligibility section, and the additional guidance provided here related to nonprofit agency Borrowers.</p>

<p>The Mortgagee must verify and document the nonprofit agency Borrower’s caseload. The Mortgagee must review the Nonprofit List in FHA Connection (FHAC), and ensure the maximum 203(k) case load limitation is not exceeded for nonprofit Borrowers.</p>

<h3>iii. Property Eligibility</h3>

<p>The Property must be an existing Property that has been completed for at least one year prior to the case number assignment date. If the Mortgagee is unsure whether the Property has been completed for at least one year, the Mortgagee must request a copy of the Certificate of Occupancy (CO) or equivalent.</p>

<p>A Property that is not eligible for a 203(b) Mortgage due to health and safety or security issues may be eligible under 203(k) if the rehabilitation or repair work performed will correct such issues.</p>

<p>A Property with an existing 203(k) Mortgage is not eligible to be refinanced until all repairs are completed and the case has been electronically closed out.</p>

<p>The following property types may be financed:</p>
<ul>
    
    <li>a one- to four-unit Single Family Structure;</li>   
    <li>an individual condominium unit, meeting the following requirements:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>the unit must be located in an FHA-approved Condominium Project and must comply with all other requirements for condominiums;</li>
        <li>rehabilitation or improvements are limited to the interior of the unit, except for the installation of firewalls in the attic for the unit;</li>
        <li>no more than five units per condominium association, or 25 percent of the total number of units, whichever is less, can undergo rehabilitation at any time; and</li>
        <li>after rehabilitation is complete, the unit is located in a Structure containing no more than four units. For townhouse style condominiums, each townhouse is considered as one Structure, provided each unit is separated by a one and one-half hour firewall from foundation to roof;</li>
    </ul>
    <li>a Site Condominium unit;</li>


    <li>Manufactured Housing where the rehabilitation does not affect the structural components of the Structure that were designed and constructed in conformance with the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards and must comply with all other requirements for Manufactured Housing;</li>

    <li>a Mixed Use Property with one- to four-residential units, provided:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>51 percent of the Gross Building Area (GBA) is for residential use; and</li>
        <li>commercial use will not affect the health and safety of the occupants of the residential Property; and</li>
    </ul>
    <li>a HUD Real Estate Owned (REO) Property:</li>
    <ul>

    </ul>
</ul>
    <h4>(A)  Dwelling Unit Limitation</h4>
    <p>A Mortgagee may determine that units in a neighborhood are not subject to the Dwelling Unit Limitation of no more than seven Dwelling Units within a two block radius when:</p>
 <ul>  
    <li>the neighborhood has been targeted by a state or local government for redevelopment or revitalization;</li>
    <li>the state or local government has approved and submitted a plan to HUD describing the program of neighborhood redevelopment and revitalization, including the geographic area targeted for redevelopment, and the nature and proportion of public or private commitments that have been made in support of the redevelopment;</li>
    <li>the nonprofit agency borrower will own no more than 10 percent of the Dwelling Units (regardless of financing type) in the designated redevelopment area; and</li>
    <li>the nonprofit agency borrower will have no more than eight Dwelling Units on adjacent lots.</li>
</ul> 
<p>The Mortgagee must review the approved redevelopment plan to ensure that the units in which the nonprofit agency has or will have a financial interest are located within the targeted geographic area. The Mortgagee must also review public records to determine that the agency does not exceed the limitations on the number of units that they may own in the redevelopment area, and that they have no more than eight adjacent units.</p>

<p>The Borrower may provide their own funds to establish the Contingency Reserves. Where the Borrower has provided their own funds for Contingency Reserves, they must be noted under a separate category in the Repair Escrow Account.</p>
<h4>(F)  Standard 203(k) Financeable Mortgage Payment Reserves</h4>

<p>A Mortgage Payment Reserve refers to an amount set aside to make Mortgage Payments when the Property cannot be occupied during rehabilitation.</p>
<p>A Mortgagee may establish a financeable Mortgage Payment Reserve, not to exceed six months of Mortgage Payments. The Mortgage Payment Reserve may include Mortgage Payments only for the period during which the Property cannot be occupied. The number of Mortgage Payments cannot exceed the completion time frame required in the Rehabilitation Loan Agreement.</p>
<p>For multi-unit properties, if one or more units are occupied, the Mortgage Payment Reserve may only include the portion of the Mortgage Payment attributable to the units that cannot be occupied. To calculate the amount that can be included in the Mortgage Payment Reserve, the Mortgagee will divide the monthly Mortgage Payment by the number of units in the Property, and multiply that figure by the number of units that cannot be occupied. The resulting figure is the amount of the Mortgage Payment that will be paid through the Mortgage Payment Reserve. The Borrower is responsible for paying the servicing Mortgagee the portion of the Mortgage not covered by the Mortgage Payment Reserve.</p>
<h4>(G)  Standard 203(k) Financeable Mortgage Fees</h4>
<p>The Mortgagee may finance the following fees and charges.</p>
<h5>(1)  Origination Fee</h5>
<p>The Mortgagee may finance a portion of the Borrower-paid origination fee not to exceed the greater of $350, or 1.5 percent of the total of the Financeable Repair and Improvement Costs and Fees, Financeable Contingency Reserves and Financeable Mortgage Payment Reserves.</p>
<h5>(2)  Discount Points</h5>
<p>The Mortgagee may finance a portion of the Borrower-paid discount points not to exceed an amount equal to the discount point percentage multiplied by the total of Financeable Repair and Improvement Costs and Fees, Financeable Contingency Reserves and Financeable Mortgage Payment Reserves.</p>
<h4>(H)  Standard 203(k) Required Documentation and Review</h4>
<h5>(1)  Review of Contractor Qualifications</h5>
<p>Prior to closing, the Mortgagee must ensure that a qualified general or specialized contractor has been hired and, by contract, has agreed to complete the work described in the Work Write-Up for the amount of the Cost Estimate and within the allotted time frame. To determine whether the contractor is qualified, the Mortgagee must review the contractor’s credentials, work experience and client references, and ensure that the contractor meets all jurisdictional licensing and bonding requirements.</p>
<h5>(2)  Consultant’s Work Write-Up and Cost Estimate</h5>
<p>The Mortgagee must obtain the Consultant’s Work Write-Up and Cost Estimate for all Standard 203(k) Mortgages. The Mortgagee must ensure the Work Write-Up/Cost Estimate specifies the type of repair and cost of each Work Item. The Mortgagee must review the Work Write-Up and ensure that all health and safety issues identified were addressed before, including additional Work Items.</p>
<h5>(3)  Architectural Exhibits</h5>
<p>The Mortgagee must obtain and review all applicable architectural exhibits.</p>
<h5>(4)  Sales Contract</h5>
<p>The Mortgagee must ensure the sales contract includes a provision that the Borrower has applied for Section 203(k) financing, and that the contract is contingent upon mortgage approval and the Borrower’s acceptance of additional required improvements as determined by the Mortgagee.</p>
<p>When the Borrower is financing a HUD REO Property, the Mortgagee must ensure that the first block on Line 4 of form HUD-9548, Instructions and Sales Contract, is checked, as well as the applicable block for 203(k).</p>

The written proposal must indicate Work Items that require permits and state that repairs are non-structural. The Cost Estimate must state the nature and type of repair and cost for each Work Item, broken down by labor and materials.</p>
<p>The Mortgagee must obtain written Cost Estimates for each Work Item, broken down by labor and materials, to be performed by the Borrower under a self-help agreement.</p>
<h5>(3)  Sales Contract</h5>
<p>The Mortgagee must obtain a copy of the sales contract and ensure that the sales contract includes a provision that the Borrower has applied for Section 203(k) financing, and that the contract is contingent upon mortgage approval and the Borrower’s acceptance of additional required improvements as determined by the Mortgagee.</p>

<h3>viii. Appraisals for Standard 203(k) and Limited 203(k)</h3>

<h4>(A)  Establishing Value</h4>
<p>The Mortgagee must establish both an Adjusted As-Is Value and an After Improved Value of the Property.</p>
<h5>(1)  Appraisal Reports</h5>
<p>An appraisal by an FHA Roster Appraiser is always required to establish the After Improved Value of the Property. Except as described below in cases of Property Flipping and refinance transactions, the Mortgagee is not required to obtain an as-is appraisal and may use alternate methods mentioned below to establish the Adjusted As-Is Value. If an as-is appraisal is obtained, the Mortgagee must use it in establishing the Adjusted As-Is Value.</p>
<h5>(2)  Adjusted As-Is Value</h5>
<p>The Mortgagee must establish the Adjusted As-Is Value as described below.</p>
<h6>(a)  Purchase Transactions</h6>
<p>For purchase transactions, the Adjusted As-Is Value is the lesser of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the purchase price less any inducements to purchase; or</li>
    <li>the As-Is Property Value.</li>
</ul>
<p>The As-Is Property Value refers to the as-is value as determined by an FHA Roster Appraiser, when an as-is appraisal is obtained.</p>

<p>In the case of Property Flipping, the Mortgagee must obtain an as-is appraisal if needed to comply with the Property Flipping guidelines.

<h6>(b)  Refinance Transactions</h6>
<h6>(i)  Properties Acquired Greater Than or Equal to 12 Months Prior to the Case Assignment Date</h6>
<p>The Mortgagee must obtain an as-is appraisal to determine the Adjusted As-Is Value when the existing debt on the Property plus the following items exceeds the After Improved Value:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Financeable Repairs and Improvement Costs;</li>
    <li>Financeable Mortgage Fees;</li>
    <li>Financeable Contingency Reserves; and</li>
    <li>Financeable Mortgage Payment Reserves (for Standard 203(k) only).</li>
</ul>
<p>When an appraisal is obtained, the Adjusted As-Is Value is the As-Is Property Value.

<p>The Mortgagee has the option of using the existing debt plus fees associated with the new Mortgage or obtaining an as-is appraisal to determine the Adjusted As-Is Value when the existing debt on the Property plus the following items does not exceed the After Improved Value:
<ul>
    <li>Financeable Repairs and Improvement Costs;</li>
    <li>Financeable Mortgage Fees;</li>
    <li>Financeable Contingency Reserves; and</li>
    <li>Financeable Mortgage Payment Reserves (for Standard 203(k) only).</li>
</ul>
<p>Existing debt includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the unpaid principal balance of the first Mortgage as of the month prior to mortgage Disbursement;</li>
    <li>the unpaid principal balance of any purchase money junior Mortgage as of the month prior to mortgage Disbursement;</li>
    <li>the unpaid principal balance of any junior liens over 12 months old as of the date of mortgage Disbursement. If the balance or any portion of an equity line of credit in excess of $1,000 was advanced within the past 12 months and was for purposes other than repairs and rehabilitation of the Property, that portion above and beyond $1,000 of the line of credit is not eligible for inclusion in the new Mortgage;</li>
    <li>interest due on the existing Mortgage(s);</li>
    <li>Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP) due on existing Mortgage;</li>
    <li>any prepayment penalties assessed;</li>
    <li>late charges; and</li>
    <li>escrow shortages.</li>
</ul>
<h6>(ii)  Properties Acquired Less Than 12 Months Prior to the Case Assignment Date</h6>
<p>For properties acquired by the Borrower within 12 months of the case number assignment date, an as-is appraisal must be obtained.</p>
<p>The Adjusted As-Is Value is the As-Is Property Value.</p>
<p>For properties acquired by the Borrower within 12 months of the case assignment date by inheritance or through a gift from a Family Member, the Mortgagee may utilize the calculation of Adjusted As-Is Value for properties acquired greater than or equal to 12 months prior to the case assignment date.</p>
<h5>(3)  After Improved Value</h5>
<p>To establish the After Improved Value, the Mortgagee must obtain an appraisal of the Property subject to the repairs and improvements.</p>
<h4>(B)  Documents to be Provided to the Appraiser at Assignment</h4>
<p>The Mortgagee must provide the Appraiser with a copy of the Consultant’s Work Write-Up and Cost Estimate for a Standard 203(k), or the work plan, contractor’s proposal and Cost Estimates for a Limited 203(k).</p>

<h3>ix. Maximum Mortgage Amount for Purchase</h3>

<p>The maximum mortgage amount that FHA will insure on a 203(k) purchase is the lesser of:
<ul>

        </ul>
        <li>110 percent of the After Improved Value (100 percent for condominiums); or</li>
    </ul>
    <li>the Nationwide Mortgage Limits.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a HUD REO 203(k) purchase utilizing the Good Neighbor Next Door (GNND) or $100 Down sales incentive, the Mortgagee must calculate the maximum mortgage amount that FHA will insure in accordance with HUD REO Purchasing.

<p>The Mortgagee is fully responsible for authorizing draw inspections, managing the rehabilitation escrow account, and approving the associated draws from the account.</p>
<p>It is the Mortgagee’s responsibility to ensure that any inspections are completed in a quality and timely manner, regardless of who performs the inspections.</p>
<h5>(1)  Release of Funds</h5>
<p>The Mortgagee may release funds only when repairs and improvements per the draw request, whether made by the contractor or Borrower, meet all federal, state, and local laws, codes and ordinances, including any required permits and inspections.</p>

<p>For an existing Structure moved to a new foundation or a Structure that will be elevated, the Mortgagee must not release mortgage proceeds for the existing Structure on the non-mortgaged Property until the new foundation has been properly inspected and the Structure has been properly placed and secured to the new foundation.</p>
<p>The Mortgagee must obtain Lien Waivers, or equivalent, at the time of any Disbursement of funds to ensure the validity of the first lien on the Property.

<p>For repairs made by the Borrower under a self-help agreement, the Mortgagee is permitted to release funds for materials only.</p>
<p>When the rehabilitation escrow account includes Mortgage Payment Reserves, the Mortgagee must make monthly Mortgage Payments directly from the interest bearing reserve account.

<p>The Mortgagee must obtain a change order detailing the additional improvements, including the costs of labor and materials.</p>

<h3>xix. Quality Control</h3>
<p>HUD will hold Mortgagees and 203(k) Consultants fully accountable for the mortgage proceeds.</p>

<p>Mortgagees must exercise due diligence with regard to the full scope of the 203(k) Consultant’s services. Standards for the 203(k) Consultant’s performance must be clearly defined in the Mortgagee’s Quality Control Plan and should be provided to each Consultant that the Mortgagee relies on in the 203(k) program. Mortgagees must evaluate and document the performance of these Consultants on at least an annual basis, to include a review of the Consultant's actual work product.</p>

<h3>xx. Servicing</h3>
<h4>(A)  Delinquencies</h4>
<p>If the Mortgage is delinquent, the Mortgagee may refuse to make further releases from the rehabilitation escrow account.</p>
<h4>(B)  Payment Default</h4>
<p>The project must stop if the Mortgage is in payment default. The Mortgagee must obtain an inspection of all repairs that have been completed up until this point by the 203(k) Consultant for a Standard 203(k), or for a Limited 203(k) by a third party. The Mortgagee may approve a release of funds for Work Items that have already been completed as of the date the work was stopped.</p>
<p>The inspection obtained by the Mortgagee must also note any items that are required to be completed to protect the interest of the collateral from deteriorating, such as a roof, and health and safety items for a Property that is occupied. The Mortgagee must ensure the completion of any Work Item that the inspection determines is necessary to protect the occupants and/or the collateral. The Mortgagee may use the services of the mortgagor’s contractor, if appropriate, or may engage the services of another qualified contractor to complete the Work Item. The Mortgagee may approve a subsequent release of funds for that Work Item.</p>
<p>The Mortgagee has the option to call the Mortgage due and payable.</p>
<p>If the default is cured, the project may resume.</p>
<h4>(C)  Bankruptcy</h4>
<p>The Mortgagee may not approve further advances if the Borrower declares bankruptcy unless otherwise required by law or as needed to protect FHA’s first lien position. The Mortgagee must obtain an inspection of all repairs that have been completed by the 203(k) Consultant for a Standard 203(k), or for a Limited 203(k) by a third party. The Mortgagee may approve a release of funds for Work Items that have already been completed as of the date the work was stopped.</p>
<h4>(D)  Foreclosure of Mortgage during Rehabilitation Period</h4>
<p>In the event of a foreclosure during rehabilitation, the Mortgagee must obtain a final inspection to determine the amount of work that has been completed since the start of construction and the cost for the work.</p>
<p>Using a format similar to the Final Release Notice, the Mortgagee will authorize release of rehabilitation escrow funds for the completed work and holdbacks on any previous Disbursements.</p>
<p>If funds remain in the rehabilitation escrow account, the Mortgagee will reduce the amount of claim (unpaid mortgage principal balance) by the unexpended funds in the rehabilitation escrow account.</p>
