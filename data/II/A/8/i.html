    <!-- <h3>i.	New Construction</h3> -->
    <h3>i.	Definitions</h3>
    
    <p>New Construction refers to Proposed Construction, Properties Under Construction, and Properties Existing Less than One Year as defined below:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Proposed Construction refers to a Property where no concrete or permanent material has been placed. Digging of footing is not considered permanent.</li>
        <li>Under Construction refers to the period from the first placement of permanent material to 100 percent completion with no Certificate of Occupancy (CO) or equivalent.</li>
        <li>Existing Less than One Year refers to a Property that is 100 percent complete and has been completed less than one year from the date of the issuance of the CO or equivalent. The Property must have never been occupied.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>FHA treats the sale of an occupied Property that has been completed less than one year from the issuance of the CO or equivalent as an existing Property.</p>
    <p>Pre-Approval refers to Properties that are less than one year old and meet one of the following requirements: </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>the Property was appraised and the Mortgagee issued form HUD-92800.5B, Conditional Commitment Direct Endorsement Statement of Appraised Value, before construction started;</li>
        <li>a building permit or its equivalent has been issued by a local jurisdiction (not applicable to Manufactured Housing); or</li>
        <li>the Mortgagee issued an Early Start Letter.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Early Start Letter refers to the document issued by the Mortgagee in response to a builder&rsquo;s request to start construction before the appraisal is completed. The Early Start Letter indicates the Mortgagee&rsquo;s approval of the Property before issuance of form HUD 92800.5B and without affecting the maximum mortgage amount. The Mortgagee can issue the Early Start Letter if local jurisdiction has issued a building permit and a case number has been assigned.</p>
    
    <p>Ten-year warranty refers to an agreement between the Borrower and a plan issuer which contains warranties regarding the construction and structural integrity of the Borrower&rsquo;s dwelling securing the FHA-insured Mortgage. The plan must be a HUD-accepted insured ten-year protection plan. </p>

    <p>For Properties greater than 90 percent but less than 100 percent completed, the Mortgagee must provide the Appraiser with a list of components to be installed or completed after the date of inspection.</p>
    
    <h3>vi.	Property Considerations</h3>

    <p>New Construction must meet HUD Minimum Property Requirements (MPR) and Minimum Property Standards (MPS).</p>

    <h3>vii.	Mortgagee Review of Appraisal</h3>

    <h4>(A)	Site Considerations</h4>

    <h5>(1)	Environmental</h5>

    <p>The Mortgagee must require corrective work to mitigate any condition that arises during construction that may affect the health and safety of the occupants, the Property&rsquo;s ability to serve as collateral, or the structural soundness of the improvements.</p>
    
    <h5>(2)	Operating Oil or Gas Wells</h5>
    
    <p>If a proposed or newly constructed dwelling is located within 75 feet of an operating oil or gas well, the Mortgagee must reject the Property unless mitigation measures are completed.</p>
    
    <h5>(3)	Slush Pits</h5>
    
    <p>If a Property is Proposed Construction near an active or abandoned Slush Pit, the Appraiser must require a survey to locate the pit. The Mortgagee is to assess any impact on the subject Property.</p>
    
    <h5>(4)	Special Airport Hazards</h5>
    
    <p>If a proposed or newly constructed Property is located within Runway Clear Zones (also known as Runway Protection Zones) at civil airports or within Clear Zones at military airfields, the Mortgagee must reject the Property for insurance.</p>
    
    <p>A proposed or newly constructed Property located in Accident Potential Zone I at military airfields may be eligible for FHA mortgage insurance provided that the Mortgagee determines that the Property complies with Department of Defense guidelines.</p>
    
    <h5>(5)	Flood Hazard Areas </h5>
    
    <p>If any portion of the property improvements (the dwelling and related Structures/equipment essential to the value of the Property and subject to flood damage) is located within a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), the Mortgagee must reject the Property, unless: </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>a final Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) or final Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) that removes the Property from the SFHA is obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); or </li>
        <li>the Mortgagee obtains a FEMA National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) Elevation Certificate (FEMA Form 81-31), that documents that the lowest floor (including the basement) of the residential building and all related improvements/equipment essential to the value of the Property, is built at or above the 100-year flood elevation in compliance with the NFIP criteria. The Mortgagee must ensure that the flood elevation certificate is prepared by a licensed engineer or surveyor and completed based on finished construction. </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The Mortgagee must include the LOMA, LOMR, or flood elevation certificate with the case when it is submitted for endorsement. </p>
    
    <p>The Mortgagee must ensure that insurance under the NFIP is obtained when a flood elevation certificate documents that the Property remains located within an SFHA.</p>
    
    <h5>(6)	Individual Water Supply Systems (Wells)</h5>
    
    <p>The Mortgagee must ensure that new wells are drilled and are no less than 20 feet deep and cased. Casing should be steel or other casing material that is durable, leak-proof, and acceptable to either the local health authority or the trade or profession licensed to drill and repair wells in the local jurisdiction. </p>
    
    <p>A well located within the foundation walls of New Construction is not acceptable except in arctic or sub-arctic regions.</p>

    <h5>(7)	Shared Well</h5>

    <p>A Shared Well is permitted only if the Mortgagee obtains evidence that:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>it is not feasible to serve the housing by an acceptable public or Community Water System; and</li>
        <li>the housing is located in an area other than in an area where local officials have certified that installation of public or adequate Community Water Systems and sewer systems are economically feasible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>(B)	Sales Comparison Approach: Comparable Selection</h4>

    <p>For Properties in new subdivisions, the selected comparable sales must include at least one sale outside the subdivision or project and at least one sale from within the subdivision or project.</p>
    
    <h3>viii.	Completion of Construction</h3>
    
    <p>Regardless of the inspection process used, the Mortgagee must certify on form HUD-92900-A, HUD/VA Addendum to Uniform Residential Loan Application, that the Property is 100 percent complete and meets HUD&rsquo;s MPR and MPS.</p>
