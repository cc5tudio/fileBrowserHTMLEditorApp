		<!-- <h3>d.	Refinances</h3> -->
		<h3>i.	Overview</h3>
		<h4>(A)	Definition</h4>
		<p>A Refinance Transaction is used to pay off the existing debt or to withdraw equity from the Property with the proceeds of a new Mortgage for a Borrower with legal title to the subject Property.</p>
		<h4>(B)	Types of Refinances</h4>
		<h5>(1)	Cash-Out</h5>
		<p>A Cash-Out Refinance is a refinance of any Mortgage or a withdrawal of equity where no Mortgage currently exists, in which the mortgage proceeds are not limited to specific purposes.</p>
		<h5>(2)	No Cash-Out</h5>
		<p>A No Cash-Out Refinance is a refinance of any Mortgage in which the mortgage proceeds are limited to the purpose of extinguishing the existing debt and costs associated with the transaction. FHA offers three types of no cash-out refinances:</p>
		<h6>(a)	Rate and Term</h6>
		<p>Rate and Term refers to a no cash-out refinance of any Mortgage in which all proceeds are used to pay existing mortgage liens on the subject Property and costs associated with the transaction.</p>
		<h6>(b)	Simple Refinance</h6>
		<p>Simple Refinance refers to a no cash-out refinance of an existing FHA-insured Mortgage in which all proceeds are used to pay the existing FHA-insured mortgage lien on the subject Property and costs associated with the transaction.</p>
		<h6>(c)	Streamline Refinance</h6>
		<p>Streamline Refinance refers to the refinance of an existing FHA-insured Mortgage requiring limited Borrower credit documentation and underwriting. There are two different streamline options available.
		<h6>(i)	Credit Qualifying</h6>
		<p>The Mortgagee must perform a credit and capacity analysis of the Borrower, but no appraisal is required.</p>
		<h6>(ii)	Non-Credit Qualifying</h6>
		<p>The Mortgagee does not need to perform credit or capacity analysis or obtain an appraisal.</p>
		<h5>(3)	Refinance of Borrowers in Negative Equity Positions (also known as Short Refinance)</h5>
		<p>A Borrower who is current on their non FHA-insured Mortgage may qualify for an FHA-insured refinance Mortgage provided that the Mortgagee or investor writes off at least 10 percent of the unpaid principal balance of the existing first lien Mortgage. (See Refinance of Borrowers in Negative Equity Positions Program (Short Refi)).</p>
		<h5>(4)	Refinances for the Purpose of Rehabilitation or Repair</h5>
		<p>A Borrower may refinance existing debts and obtain additional financing for purposes of rehabilitation and repair. Refer to 203(k) Rehabilitation Mortgage Insurance Program for guidelines for refinances under FHA&rsquo;s Section 203(k) program.</p>
		<h5>(5)	Refinancing of an Existing Section 235 Mortgage</h5>
		<p>An existing Section 235 Mortgage may be refinanced as any no cash-out refinance.</p>
		<p>In refinancing a Section 235 Mortgage, the Mortgagee is required to repay to FHA any amount of excess subsidy. The outstanding principal balance on a Section 235 is calculated by adding back to the balance any amount of the excess subsidy paid to FHA.</p>
		<p>If FHA has a junior lien that was part of the original Section 235 financing, FHA will subordinate the junior lien to the Section 203(b) Mortgage that refinances the Section 235 Mortgage.</p>
		<h3>ii.	General Eligibility</h3>
		<h4>(A)	FHA-Insured to FHA-Insured Refinances (FHA-to-FHA)</h4>
		<p>FHA-to-FHA refinances may be used with any refinance type. The Mortgagee must obtain a Refinance Authorization Number from FHA Connection (FHAC) for all FHA-to-FHA refinances.</p>
		<p>FHA will not issue a new case number for any FHA to FHA Refinance where the existing Mortgage to be paid off has a repair or rehabilitation escrow account that the Escrow Closeout Certification has not been completed in FHAC.</p>
		<h4>(B)	General Borrower Eligibility </h4>
		<p>At least one Borrower on the refinancing Mortgage must hold title to the Property being refinanced prior to case number assignment.</p>
		<h4>(C)	General Property Eligibility</h4>
		<p>For a transaction involving a Manufactured Home to be considered a refinance, the Manufactured Home must have been permanently erected on a site for more than twelve months prior to case number assignment.</p>
		<h4>(D)	General Mortgage Eligibility</h4>
		<h5>(1)	Standard</h5>
		<p>For cases endorsed on or before September 30, 2015, the Mortgagee must not approve any Mortgage that refinances or otherwise replaces a Mortgage that has been subject to eminent domain condemnation or seizure, by a state, municipality, or any other political subdivision of a state.</p>
		<h5>(2)	Required Documentation</h5>
		<p>If the Mortgage to be insured is located in an area where a state, municipality, or other political subdivision has exercised eminent domain condemnation or seizure of a Mortgage, the Mortgagee must obtain a certification from the Borrower stating the Mortgage being refinanced was not subject to eminent domain condemnation or seizure.</p>
		<h3>iii.	Temporary Interest Rate Buydowns</h3>
		<p>Temporary interest rate buydowns are not permitted with refinance transactions.</p>
		<h3>iv.	Upfront Mortgage Insurance Premium Refunds</h3>
		<p>If the Borrower is refinancing their current FHA-insured Mortgage to another FHA-insured Mortgage within 3 years, a refund credit is applied to reduce the amount of the Upfront Mortgage Insurance Premium (UFMIP) paid on the refinanced Mortgage, according to the refund schedule shown in the table below:</p>

                <li>the sum of existing debt and costs associated with the transaction as follows:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>existing debt includes:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the unpaid principal balance of the first Mortgage as of the month prior to mortgage Disbursement;</li>
                        <li>the unpaid principal balance of any purchase money junior Mortgage as of the month prior to mortgage Disbursement;</li>
                        <li>the unpaid principal balance of any junior liens over 12 months old as of the date of mortgage Disbursement. If the balance or any portion of an equity line of credit in excess of $1,000 was advanced within the past 12 months and was for purposes other than repairs and rehabilitation of the Property, that portion above and beyond $1,000 of the line of credit is not eligible for inclusion in the new Mortgage;</li>
                        <li>ex-spouse or co-Borrower equity, as described in &ldquo;Refinancing to Buy out Title Holder Equity&rdquo; below;</li>

		<h6>Short Payoffs</h6>

		<h6>Refinancing to Buy Out Title-Holder Equity</h6>
		<p>When the purpose of the new Mortgage is to refinance an existing Mortgage to buy out an existing title-holder&rsquo;s equity, the specified equity to be paid is considered property-related indebtedness and eligible to be included in the new mortgage calculation.

		<h6>Excess Cash Back</h6>
		<p>When the estimated costs utilized in calculating the maximum mortgage amount result in greater than $500 cash back to the Borrower at mortgage Disbursement, Mortgagees may reduce the Borrower&rsquo;s outstanding principal balance to satisfy the $500 cash back requirement. The Mortgagee must submit the Mortgage for endorsement at the reduced principle amount.</p>

		<p>The Mortgagee must obtain the payoff statement on all existing Mortgages.</p>
		<h6>(c)	Maximum Combined Loan-to-Value Ratio</h6>
