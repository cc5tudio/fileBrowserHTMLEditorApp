    <!-- <h3>Section 251 Adjustable Rate Mortgages</h3> -->
    <h3>i.	Definition</h3>

    <p>An Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) refers to a Mortgage in which the interest rate can change annually based on an index plus a margin.</p>

    <h3>ii.	Required Disclosures</h3>

    <p>The Borrower must sign a disclosure that explains the terms of the ARM at mortgage application.</p>

    <h3>iii.	ARM Types </h3>

    <p>The Mortgagee must establish the initial interest rate and the margin. The margin must be constant for the entire term of the Mortgage.</p>
    <p>The interest rate must remain constant for an initial period of 1, 3, 5, 7, or 10 years, depending on the ARM program chosen by the Borrower, and then may change annually for the remainder of the mortgage term. </p>
    <p>A 1- and 3-year ARM may increase by one percentage point annually after the initial fixed interest rate period, and five percentage points over the life of the Mortgage.</p>
    <p>A 5-year ARM may either allow for increases of one percentage point annually, and five percentage points over the life of the Mortgage; or increases of two percentage points annually, and six points over the life of the Mortgage.</p>
    <p>A 7- and 10-year ARM may only increase by two percentage points annually after the initial fixed interest rate period, and six percentage points over the life of the Mortgage.</p>
    
    <h3>iv.	Initial Interest Rate Adjustments </h3>
    
    <p>The first interest rate adjustment must occur in accordance with the following chart:</p>
